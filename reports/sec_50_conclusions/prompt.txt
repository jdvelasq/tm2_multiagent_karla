PAPER TITLE:
A Text Mining-Based Thematic Review of Multi-Agent Systems in Supply Chain Optimization and Decision Support


PAPER ABSTRACT:
This study conducts a comprehensive thematic analysis of 437 Scopus-indexed documents to explore the evolving landscape of multi-agent systems (MAS) in supply chain management. Five dominant research clusters are identified using a text mining methodology, capturing key developments in real-time decision support, distributed optimization, agent-based coordination, intelligent logistics, and sustainable operations. The findings highlight how MASs are increasingly integrated with mixed-integer programming, reinforcement learning, and cyber-physical systems to address last-mile delivery, inventory control, and disruption management. Unlike prior reviews focused on isolated MAS applications, this study presents a cross-cutting synthesis of technological and managerial trends that shape digital supply chain ecosystems. Challenges such as scalability, agent interoperability, and real-time coordination under uncertainty are critically examined. Strategic insights and future research directions are proposed to guide the design of interpretable, hybrid MAS frameworks that support agile, sustainable, and resilient production and logistics systems. This review advances production research by offering an evidence-based roadmap for leveraging MAS in complex supply chain environments. It supports decision-makers in aligning technological innovation with operational performance and strategic goals.


OVERVIEW:
Multi-agent systems (MASs) in supply chains represent a foundational shift from centralized control architectures to decentralized, autonomous networks capable of managing complexity, uncertainty, and dynamic interactions across production and logistics environments. Defined as distributed computational systems, MASs are intelligent, autonomous software agents that interact, negotiate, and collaborate to simulate coordinated decision-making processes across diverse supply chain functions (Chen & Xu, 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Yu & Wong, 2015). Each agent operates with localized intelligence yet contributes to collective goals, enabling the system to self-organize and adapt to disruptions, demand fluctuations, or conflicting constraints (Baena et al., 2020; Rzevski et al., 2018; Sun & Sun, 2016). This autonomy fosters flexibility and resilience in networks challenged by evolving market demands, interdependencies, and environmental pressures (Kessentini et al., 2019; Ponnambalam et al., 2015; Skobelev, 2018). The literature consistently identifies MASs as decision-aid models that improve coordination, enhance planning accuracy, and support adaptive scheduling and resource allocation (Li et al., 2019; Padmavathi et al., 2016; Rebollo et al., 2018). These models are particularly well-suited for distributed environments, where they align stakeholder objectives without centralized oversight, enabling collaborative responses to logistical challenges (Achatbi et al., 2020; Laouadi et al., 2017; Yan, 2015). MASs extend their relevance by modeling complex adaptive systems, offering real-time negotiation capabilities, and facilitating multi-objective optimization—characteristics that are central to modern supply chain intelligence (Bala et al., 2024; Darbari & Ahmad, 2019; Du et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2021; H. Zhang, 2024). In urban logistics and last-mile delivery, MASs are applied to manage decentralized transport systems by leveraging autonomous agents for real-time coordination among delivery vehicles, logistics firms, and even crowdsourced participants. These agents optimize delivery routes, balance economic and environmental objectives, and reduce traffic congestion and emissions by dynamically adapting to infrastructure and demand changes (Arishi & Krishnan, 2023; Bu, 2024; Dharmapriya et al., 2022; Gómez-Marín et al., 2023). This integration into city logistics underlines MASs’ scalability and sustainability, offering flexible frameworks that can be tailored to diverse delivery scenarios. Collectively, these approaches affirm MAS as transformative technologies that effectively support the strategic, adaptive, and operational objectives of modern supply chain systems. Their contributions to distributed intelligence, systemic resilience, and computational decision-making firmly position MAS at the forefront of innovation in production and logistics. Moreover, MASs directly align with key research areas in production research, including production system and supply network engineering, the analysis of essential behaviors of production resources and systems, the development of production strategies and related economic considerations, the formulation and evaluation of production policies, production planning, and scheduling, and the application of production research to service-oriented environments.


JUSTIFICATION:
At the time of writing, only five documents published since 2015 are classified as reviews on MASs in supply chains in Scopus. Teo et al. (2015) evaluated the effectiveness and viability of urban distribution centers (UDCs) in city logistics using a multi-agent modeling approach supported by geographic information systems. The study addressed current challenges to delivery efficiency, such as depot distance, road restrictions, customer demands, and socio-environmental costs, which are exacerbated by increasing urbanization. Using a case study in Osaka City, Japan, the authors found that UDCs have the potential to reduce emissions; however, their sustainability depends heavily on the pricing of UDC services and the sensitivity of carriers to these charges. 


PAPER OBJECTIVES:
The necessity of a new review on MASs in supply chains is driven by both the rapid evolution of the field and the increasingly complex challenges faced by modern logistics and production systems. While previous reviews have contributed important insights, they often present a fragmented or narrow perspective, focusing on isolated applications, specific industrial sectors, or theoretical discussions without fully capturing the integrated impact of MASs across the broader supply chain landscape. The diversity of methodologies used and the absence of a consistent analytical framework have further limited the ability to derive generalizable conclusions or best practices applicable to complex, distributed logistics environments. Therefore, A new review is warranted to consolidate and critically examine the current state of research on MASs in supply chains, focusing on identifying dominant thematic areas, methodological trends, and gaps that hinder broader adoption and innovation. This review will provide a systematic and nuanced field mapping by employing text mining techniques—extracting and analyzing noun phrases from abstracts, titles, author keywords, and index keywords. This review aims to systematically investigate and synthesize the current research on applying MASs in city logistics, urban freight, and last-mile delivery. The review seeks to uncover and critically examine the dominant thematic clusters within the literature using tech-mining techniques to analyze noun phrases (extracted from abstracts and titles), author, and index keywords. This data-driven approach identifies coherent research domains and supports a nuanced exploration of prevailing trends, critical challenges, and emerging opportunities. Through this comprehensive synthesis, the review intends to bridge existing knowledge gaps, enhance understanding of MAS applications in urban logistics, and promote the development of innovative, context-sensitive solutions. The resulting analysis will offer a structured roadmap for future academic inquiry and practical implementation, particularly as urban environments become increasingly complex and demand more flexible, intelligent, and resilient logistics systems. This review is also strategically aligned with the broader objectives of advancing production research. It contributes to developing decision-aid frameworks, optimizing planning and scheduling processes, and integrating intelligent technologies into modern supply chain and logistics systems. By addressing both the theoretical underpinnings and practical dimensions of MAS deployment, the review responds to the growing demand for scalable, adaptable, and computationally robust approaches to managing interdependent and dynamic logistics networks. As such, it offers a timely and relevant contribution to the ongoing transformation of urban supply chain systems.
