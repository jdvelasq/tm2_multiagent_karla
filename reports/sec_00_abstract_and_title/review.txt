The introduction of the paper is:

"""
Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) is an innovative technology designed for environments with limited resources, like embedded systems and the Internet of Things (IoT). It focuses on deploying machine learning (ML) models on devices with limited power, memory, and computational capacity, such as microcontrollers and edge devices [1], [2], [3], [4]. This enables real-time AI processing without relying on cloud infrastructure, making TinyML a critical component in edge computing [5], [6]. By operating directly on low-power devices, TinyML supports real-time data processing, energy-efficient decision-making, and autonomous operations, all while reducing latency, enhancing data privacy, and minimizing energy consumption [7], [8], [9]. The critical significance of TinyML lies in its ability to bridge the gap between traditional ML methods and the constrained environments of edge devices [10], [11]. TinyML leverages techniques such as model optimization and incremental learning to enable devices to perform environmental monitoring, anomaly detection, structural health monitoring, and predictive maintenance with minimal computational resources [2], [4], [12]. This capability makes it a key enabler in applications requiring real-time processing, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) security, smart agriculture, and healthcare diagnostics [13], [14], [15], [16]. TinyML also plays a vital role in reducing the dependency on cloud services. By allowing ML models to perform on-device inference, TinyML enhances data privacy and security, ensuring that sensitive data remains local to the device [8], [17], [18]. This mitigates privacy concerns and reduces operational costs associated with cloud connectivity [5], [10], [19]. TinyML’s energy efficiency also allows for sustainable operations in IoT ecosystems, which rely heavily on low-power devices for long-term functionality [11], [20], [21]. One of the most notable aspects of TinyML is its ability to revolutionize real-time decision-making systems in various industries. Implementing lightweight models on constrained devices enables intelligent systems to operate autonomously in environments where latency and energy efficiency are paramount [4], [7], [11], [22]. By minimizing computational and memory requirements, TinyML extends the reach of AI to domains such as healthcare, agriculture, and industrial monitoring [23], [24], [25], fostering the development of scalable, low-cost, and sustainable AI solutions [13], [26]. As TinyML continues to evolve, its integration of hardware-software co-design ensures that models can balance accuracy and resource constraints, further driving advancements in edge computing and IoT [9], [27]. The potential of TinyML makes it a cornerstone technology for the future of AI in resource-constrained settings, enabling smarter, more efficient, and scalable applications across a wide range of industries [28], [29], [30].

The rapidly growing field of TinyML has become a central area of research. When writing this paper, Scopus recorded 17 documents categorized as reviews. Many of these reviews have focused on integrating TinyML with IoT devices [31], enhancing techniques for settings with limited resources [32], and advancements in hardware-software co-design [33]. Current reviews offer valuable insights into various applications, such as healthcare [34], environmental monitoring [35], and industrial processes [36]. These studies highlight the benefits of deploying ML models on low-power devices, which enable real-time decision-making without reliance on cloud services [37]. However, the analyzed reviews concentrate on individual areas, leading to a need for a better understanding of the interconnected challenges and emerging research fields across various domains. Although these literature reviews are accessible, there remains a need for a thorough analysis that covers global research trends, challenges, and future directions in TinyML. A broader examination is essential to pinpoint overarching patterns and trends across various disciplines. 

This paper aims to apply text mining techniques to analyze and critically examine the dominant research clusters in TinyML, which will fill this gap. By investigating research across multiple sectors, this review will highlight key trends such as advances in model optimization [38], data privacy [39], and hardware development [33]. It will also address significant challenges, including balancing accuracy with processing capacity and memory constraints in resource-limited devices [39], [39]. Furthermore, this review will identify future research directions, such as improving energy efficiency and exploring new applications in large-scale IoT deployments [32]. This review provides a comprehensive overview of global TinyML research. It aims to offer valuable insights into emerging trends and foster innovation, ultimately supporting both academic research and industrial applications of TinyML. This review does not focus on specific applications or individual industries.
