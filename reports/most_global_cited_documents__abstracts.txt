AB the oil and GAS_INDUSTRY (ogi) has always been associated with challenges
   and complexities.  it involves many processes and STAKEHOLDERS, each
   generating a HUGE_AMOUNT of data.  due to the global and distributed nature
   of the business, PROCESSING and managing this information is an
   ARDUOUS_TASK. many issues such as orchestrating DIFFERENT_DATA_SOURCES,
   owners and formats; verifying, validating and securing DATA_STREAMS as they
   move along the COMPLEX_BUSINESS_PROCESS_PIPELINE; and getting insights from
   data for improving BUSINESS_EFFICIENCY, SCHEDULING_MAINTENANCE and
   preventing theft and fraud are to be addressed.  ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE
   (ai), and MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) in particular, have gained HUGE_ACCEPTANCE
   in many areas recently, including the ogi, to help HUMANS_TACKLE
   SUCH_COMPLEX_TASKS. furthermore, multi_agent systems (MAS) as a sub_field of
   distributed AI_MEET the requirement of DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEMS and have been
   utilised successfully in a VAST_VARIETY of disciplines.  several studies
   have explored the use of ml and MAS to increase OPERATIONAL_EFFICIENCY,
   manage SUPPLY_CHAIN and solve various production_ and maintenance_related
   tasks in the ogi.  however, ml has only been applied to isolated tasks, and
   while MAS have yielded GOOD_PERFORMANCE in simulated environments, they have
   not gained the expected popularity among oil and GAS_COMPANIES yet.  further
   RESEARCH in the fields is necessary to realise the potential of ml and MAS
   and encourage their wider acceptance in the ogi.  in particular, embedding
   ml into MAS can bring many benefits for the FUTURE_DEVELOPMENT of the
   INDUSTRY. this PAPER_AIMS to summarise the efforts to date of applying ml
   and MAS to OGI_TASKS, identify POSSIBLE_REASONS for their low and
   SLOW_UPTAKE and suggest ways to ensure a greater adoption of these
   technologies in the ogi.  2019 ELSEVIER_INC.

AB SYSTEMS_ENGINEERING is an UBIQUITOUS_DISCIPLINE of engineering overlapping
   industrial, chemical, mechanical, MANUFACTURING, CONTROL, software,
   electrical, and CIVIL_ENGINEERING. it provides TOOLS for dealing with the
   COMPLEXITY and DYNAMICS related to the OPTIMISATION of physical, natural,
   and VIRTUAL_SYSTEMS_MANAGEMENT. this paper presents a REVIEW of how
   multi_agent systems and COMPLEX_NETWORKS_THEORY are brought together to
   ADDRESS_SYSTEMS_ENGINEERING and MANAGEMENT_PROBLEMS. the REVIEW also
   encompasses CURRENT and FUTURE_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS both for
   THEORETICAL_FUNDAMENTALS and APPLICATIONS in the INDUSTRY. this is made by
   considering trends such as mesoscale, multiscale, and MULTILAYER_NETWORKS
   along with the state_of_art analysis on NETWORK_DYNAMICS and
   INTELLIGENT_NETWORKS. critical and SMART_INFRASTRUCTURE,
   MANUFACTURING_PROCESSES, and SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS are instances of
   RESEARCH_TOPICS for which this LITERATURE_REVIEW is highly relevant.  2020

AB CURRENT_BARRIERS to maintaining economies of scale for delivery include far
   distances of the depots from CUSTOMERS, ROAD_USAGE_RESTRICTIONS, CUSTOMERS'
   DELIVERY_REQUESTS, and social, environmental, and ECONOMIC_COSTS. in many
   developed and DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES, the effects of urbanization have
   increased CITY_POPULATION. SUCH_MIGRATION to cities is also attracting more
   movement of commodities into the CITY_CENTER. this RESEARCH aimed to study
   the effectiveness and VIABILITY of URBAN_DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS from a
   TACTICAL_VIEWPOINT of PLANNING for CITY_LOGISTICS. a MULTIAGENT_MODELING
   approach with GEOGRAPHICAL_INFORMATION_SYSTEM_SUPPORT was used to test an
   URBAN_DISTRIBUTION_CENTER (udc) in OSAKA_CITY, JAPAN. the KEY_FINDINGS from
   this RESEARCH concluded that the udc has potential for EMISSIONS_REDUCTION,
   but SUSTAINABILITY of the udc is reliant on the UDC_CHARGES and carriers'
   sensitivity to the rate of charges.

AB with the DEVELOPMENT of GLOBAL_ECONOMY, SUPPLY_CHAIN, as a recognised
   COMPLEX_SYSTEM, is becoming more complex for analysis.  in this context, it
   is worth introducing the perspective of COMPLEX_SYSTEM in perceiving and
   MODELLING of SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM to address ITS dynamic, stochastic and
   UNCERTAIN_CHARACTERISTICS. therefore, this paper proposes a
   METHODOLOGICAL_FRAMEWORK of SUPPLY_CHAIN MODELLING_AND_SIMULATION based on
   the FRACTAL_PERSPECTIVE, and presents an all_round and SYSTEMATIC_EXPOSITION
   of concept MODELLING and DISTRIBUTED_SIMULATION by means of multi_agent
   TECHNOLOGY. in this framework, different SUPPLY_CHAIN scenarios focusing on
   MANUFACTURING, INVENTORY and TRANSPORTATION can be easily modelled and
   simulated at DIFFERENT_SCALES and levels.  in addition, a PROTOTYPE_SYSTEM
   which implements the METHODOLOGICAL_FRAMEWORK and the
   KEY_IMPLEMENTATION_TECHNIQUES are presented as well.  finally, a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_EXAMPLE, which SUPPOSES_MANUFACTURER as the CORE_MEMBER, is
   modelled and simulated with the PROTOTYPE_SYSTEM to illustrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed framework.  2014 taylor and francis.
