Title: an AGENT based NEGOTIATION_MODEL for SUPPLIER_SELECTION of
MULTIPLE_PRODUCTS with SYNERGY_EFFECT
Abstract:
```
SUPPLIER_SELECTION is an IMPORTANT_PROBLEM in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT
(SCM), and has attracted the attention of many researchers.
TREMENDOUS_EFFORT has been spent on the DEVELOPMENT of agent_based
systems to AUTOMATE_SUPPLIER_SELECTION_NEGOTIATION_PROCESS in
SCM_APPLICATIONS. in this kind of multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS),
SOFTWARE_AGENTS are established to represent VARIOUS_PARTIES and
FUNCTIONS involving in the SUPPLIER_SELECTION_NEGOTIATION_PROCESS. most
of CURRENT_SYSTEMS only deal with relatively SIMPLE_NEGOTIATIONS
involving the acquisition of one product, they are not sufficient to
support COMPLEX_NEGOTIATIONS involving MULTIPLE_PRODUCTS with
SYNERGY_EFFECT. however, in practice, it is common for a PURCHASING
company to procure MULTIPLE_PRODUCTS simultaneously, and the synergy
effects that exist between products could affect the FINAL_CHOICE of
COOPERATIVE_SUPPLIERS. this paper presents an agent_based
NEGOTIATION_MODEL to automate the SUPPLIER_SELECTION_PROCESS involving a
bundle of products with SYNERGY_EFFECT. a MAS is established to realize
the proposed NEGOTIATION_MODEL for multi_product SUPPLIER_SELECTION.
furthermore, the NEGOTIATION_PROPOSAL, NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL,
NEGOTIATION_STRATEGIES, and DECISION_MAKING_METHODS involving in the
NEGOTIATION_MODEL are elaborated for the multi_product SUPPLIER_SELECTION
ENVIRONMENT. through the proposed NEGOTIATION_MODEL, the PURCHASING
company and SUPPLIERS can reach agreements on the details of products
simultaneously and exploit the SYNERGY_EFFECT between products. finally,
ILLUSTRATIVE_EXAMPLES are conducted to demonstrate the function and
effectiveness of the NEGOTIATION_MODEL for multi_product
SUPPLIER_SELECTION.  2014 ELSEVIER_LTD. all rights reserved.

Title: an AGENT based FUZZY constraint directed NEGOTIATION_MODEL for solving
SUPPLY_CHAIN PLANNING and SCHEDULING_PROBLEMS
Abstract:
```
SUPPLY_CHAIN PLANNING and SCHEDULING_PROBLEMS require MANUFACTURERS
(PROJECT_MANAGERS) to determine PRODUCT_CONFIGURATIONS, SELECT_SUPPLIERS
(CONTRACTORS) for TASK_ALLOCATION, and SCHEDULE_PROJECT_TASKS while
considering VARIOUS_PRODUCTION_CONSTRAINTS among MANUFACTURERS and
SUPPLIERS. most RELEVANT_STUDIES have focused on finding an
OPTIMAL_SOLUTION based on COMPLETE_INFORMATION provided by each
ENTERPRISE in a SUPPLY_CHAIN. however, the PRACTICAL_IMPLEMENTATION of
COMPLETE_INFORMATION SHARING is difficult, if not impossible, because of
the fully distributed nature of the SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROCESS. this work
proposes an agent_based FUZZY constraint_directed NEGOTIATION (afcn)
MODEL to solve problems associated with SUPPLY_CHAIN
PLANNING_AND_SCHEDULING, which are modeled as a set of
FUZZY_CONSTRAINT_SATISFACTION_PROBLEMS (fcsps) that are interlinked via
inter_agent constraints. to accommodate the perspectives and interests of
each ENTERPRISE in a SUPPLY_CHAIN, CONFLICTS among fcsps are resolved
using the AFCN_PROTOCOL through the ITERATIVE_EXCHANGE of
offers/counter_offers with limited INFORMATION_SHARING and without
PRIVACY_BREACHES. a proposed offer/counter_offer represents not only a
set of ACCEPTABLE_SOLUTIONS and preferences for an OPERATIONAL_TASK but
also the possibility of CONFLICT in this area. for each fcsp, the
INCREMENTAL_PROCESS of offer/counter_offer EVALUATION eliminates
redundant and INFEASIBLE_SOLUTIONS. the SHARING of limited non_strategic
SENSITIVE_INFORMATION among AGENTS enables them to elucidate their
OPPONENTS_INTENTIONS through ITERATIVE_NEGOTIATIONS, such that the AGENTS
can reach an agreement while ensuring that the solution to a
PROJECT_PLANNING and SCHEDULING_PROBLEM is satisfactory. the AFCN_MODEL
is also sufficiently flexible to incorporate
DIFFERENT_NEGOTIATION_STRATEGIES such as competitive, win_win, and
COLLABORATIVE_STRATEGIES, for VARIOUS_PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENTS. herein, a
NUMERICAL_STUDY was conducted to examine the PRACTICAL_VIABILITY and
effectiveness of the proposed AFCN_MODEL. the EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS show
that the proposed AFCN_MODEL not only can generate a SCHEDULE that is
comparable to a near_optimal solution but also is time_efficient. this
indicates that the proposed afcn is a practical and EFFECTIVE_METHOD for
solving SUPPLY_CHAIN PLANNING and SCHEDULING_PROBLEMS in fully
DISTRIBUTED_ENVIRONMENTS.  2016 elsevier b.v.

Title: a HYBRID MULTI_AGENT NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL supporting SUPPLIER_SELECTION
for MULTIPLE_PRODUCTS with SYNERGY_EFFECT
Abstract:
```
SUPPLIER_SELECTION is an IMPORTANT_PROBLEM in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. in
practice, it is common for a PURCHASING company to procure a bundle of
products simultaneously. in this regard, SYNERGY_EFFECT could exist
between products and hence affect the FINAL_CHOICE of SUPPLIERS. it is
therefore necessary to incorporate the SYNERGY_EFFECT between products in
SUPPLIER_SELECTION_PROCESS. agent_based NEGOTIATION_MODELS are applied to
AUTOMATE_SUPPLIER_SELECTION_PROCESS. NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL is an
ESSENTIAL_COMPONENT should be considered when building an
EFFECTIVE_AGENT_NEGOTIATION_MODEL. the OBJECTIVE of this RESEARCH is to
propose a NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL special for multi_product
SUPPLIER_SELECTION problem. the NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL is a HYBRID
multi_agent PROTOCOL of COMBINATORIAL_PROCUREMENT_AUCTION_PROTOCOL and
multi_bilateral BARGAINING PROTOCOL. the NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL is able to
support the PURCHASING company and SUPPLIERS negotiate on the
CONCRETE_COMMITMENTS of MULTIPLE_PRODUCTS simultaneously, and
SELECT_SUPPLIERS for MULTIPLE_PRODUCTS. in addition, both the PURCHASING
company and SUPPLIERS can express their preferences on the SYNERGY_EFFECT
between products in NEGOTIATION_PROCESS by adopting the
NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL. SIMULATION is conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness and EFFICIENCY of the NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL.  2016

Title: RESEARCH on NEGOTIATION of MANUFACTURING_ENTERPRISE SUPPLY_CHAIN based on
MULTI_AGENT
Abstract:
```
in the multi_agent SYSTEM of MANUFACTURING_ENTERPRISE SUPPLY_CHAIN, each
NODE_ENTERPRISE has DIFFERENT_DEMANDS on the price, quality, COST,
DELIVERY_TIME, quantity, RESPONSE_TIME, SERVICE_CONDITIONS and other
factors, that will cause lots of CONFLICTS between SUPPLY_CHAIN partners,
and NEGOTIATION is the BASIC_MEANS to solve these CONFLICTS. in this
paper, a multi_objective NEGOTIATION_MODEL will be presented, and then
NEGOTIATING_TACTICS and steps between PURCHASING AGENT and SUPPLIER_AGENT
will be discussed. next, an example is discussed and simulated by
COMPUTER_TECHNOLOGY for validating the NEGOTIATING_MODEL. it is helpful
to save NEGOTIATION_TIME and improve NEGOTIATION_EFFICIENCY, and optimize
the MANUFACTURING_ENTERPRISE SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. based on this,
MANUFACTURING_ENTERPRISE can maximize the benefits and improve the

Title: an AGENT based approach for project driven SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROBLEM under
INFORMATION_ASYMMETRY and DECENTRALIZED DECISION_MAKING
Abstract:
```
in a project_driven SUPPLY_CHAIN, the PROJECT_SCHEDULE and material
SUPPLY influence one another. the effective decision_making PROCESS
between the PROJECT_MANAGER and the SUPPLIERS can promote the FLEXIBILITY
and COMPETITIVENESS of SUPPLY_CHAINS. however, due to their
INCOMPATIBLE_OBJECTIVES, the SUPPLIERS are reluctant to disclose
PRIVATE_INFORMATION. by incorporating INFORMATION_ASYMMETRY, we build a
MODEL to describe the DECENTRALIZED decision_making PROCESS. the
PROJECT_MANAGER does not know the LEAD_TIME and the
PRODUCTION/TRANSPORTATION_COST of the MATERIAL_SUPPLIERS accurately. to
build an EFFECTIVE_ALLIANCE in the SUPPLY_CHAIN, DIFFERENT_CONTRACTS are
considered to provide a positive or NEGATIVE_INCENTIVE for the SUPPLIERS,
including a non_financial INCENTIVE contract with CONTINUOUS_ORDERS.
then, we present a framework that integrates the agent_based approach and
EVOLUTIONARY_ALGORITHM. in the framework, the AGENTS not only negotiate
with each other to complete a solution but also jointly evaluate the
SOLUTIONS generated by the EVOLUTIONARY_ALGORITHM. finally, an experiment
is conducted to compare the agent_based approach and the classical
nsga_ii under INFORMATION_SYMMETRY. the results show that the gap between
the ALGORITHMS is acceptable, especially for a LARGE_PROJECT. the results
also show that the non_financial INCENTIVE contract is beneficial to all
the players in the SUPPLY_CHAIN.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: MODELING_AND_SIMULATION of a MULTI_AGENT green
SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM for RETAILERS
Abstract:
```
in RECENT_YEARS, the AGENT_TECHNOLOGY has been successfully applied in
SUPPLY_CHAINS, thanks to ITS EXCELLENT_INTERACTIVITY, PROACTIVITY, and
AUTONOMY. however, the existing RESEARCH on multi_agent green
SUPPLY_CHAIN (gsc) stops on the strategic and TACTICAL_LEVELS, failing to
implement the relevant SUPPLY_CHAIN MODELS. to overcome the limitation,
this PAPER_DESIGNS a multi_agent gsc MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM for RETAILERS,
with the aim to obtain SCIENTIFIC_COLLABORATION_STRATEGIES among
MULTIPLE_AGENTS and to make EFFECTIVE_LOGISTICS_DECISIONS for the
SUPPLY_CHAIN. firstly, a 3_layer hierarchical EVALUATION index SYSTEM
(eis) was established under the framework of the multi_agent gsc
MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM. next, the authors modeled the supply_demand
relationship and DYNAMIC_GAME of multi_agent gsc, and discussed the
COOPERATION and NEGOTIATION_MODELS among MULTIPLE_AGENTS.
EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS show that the proposed multi_agent gsc MANAGEMENT
MODEL is highly effective. the RESEARCH_FINDINGS provide a reference for

Title: DECENTRALIZED MANUFACTURING MANAGEMENT by a MULTI_AGENT OPTIMAL_CONTROL
method
Abstract:
```
a SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM is defined as communications among
SUPPLIERS, PLANTS, DISTRIBUTION_CENTRES, RETAILERS and DEMAND_STIMULUS.
these systems are LARGE_SCALE and multi_agent, and therefore a
DECENTRALIZED CONTROL_METHOD must be used. also, DEMAND_FORECASTING, as a
challenge in PRODUCTION_MANAGEMENT, can be estimated by advanced methods
or modelled using DEMAND_FORECASTING FUNCTIONS. in this paper, a new
DECENTRALIZED receding HORIZON_CONTROL_METHOD is used to achieve
CUSTOMER_CONTENTMENT and low_cost INVENTORY in a COMPLETE_CHAIN of
SUPPLY, MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLY, WAREHOUSE, DISTRIBUTION and RETAIL_UNITS.
the MAIN_NOVELTY of the METHOD_RETURNS to the use of both the
MOVE_SUPPRESSION_TERM and the look_ahead idea to increase ROBUSTNESS and
smoothness in a SUPPLY_CHAIN containing ASSEMBLY_UNITS. also, a
KALMAN_FILTER_ESTIMATOR is applied to ESTIMATE_STATES and
OUTPUT_VARIABLES. for this purpose, a SUITABLE_MODEL and
APPROPRIATE_OPTIMAL_CONTROL_METHOD are developed. finally, the EFFICIENCY
is indicated regarding SIMULATION_RESULTS.  2014, SAGE_PUBLICATIONS. all

Title: INFORMATION_COLLABORATION_MODEL of CLOUD_COMPUTING SUPPLY_CHAIN based on
MULTI_AGENT
Abstract:
```
in order to improve the WORK_EFFICIENCY of SUPPLY_CHAIN in
CLOUD_COMPUTING and avoid the RISKS of CLOUD_COMPUTING, a cloud_based
SUPPLY_CHAIN INFORMATION_COORDINATION MODEL was proposed. the MODEL has
two BASIC_STATES which are ONLINE_STATUS and OFFLINE_STATUS, at
ONLINE_STATE the CLOUD_COMPUTING center is responsible for COORDINATION
of the entire SUPPLY_CHAIN information, and at OFFLINE_STATE each node
continues to complete the TRANSACTION_ORDER through the HISTORY_RECORD
and each NODE_INFORMATION in the CLOUD_DATA_CENTER. SIMULATION based on
multi_agent shows that the ORDER_COMPLETION_RATE in OFFLINE_STATUS is
slightly lower than that in ONLINE_STATUS, and can meet the users'
REGULAR_REQUIREMENTS in CLOUD_COMPUTING SUPPLY_CHAIN.
EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS confirm that the MODEL is feasible, and the
OFFLINE_STATUS can effectively avoid the risk in the CLOUD_COMPUTING
ENVIRONMENT.  2016, the EDITORIAL_BOARD of journal of SYSTEM_SIMULATION.

Title: MODELING of negotiations between SUPPLY_CHAIN participants based on a
MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM
Abstract:
```
currently, to solve the problem of MODELING negotiations between
SUPPLY_CHAIN participants, multi_agent systems with more than two AGENTS
are used. to formalize the NEGOTIATION_PROCESS between AGENTS, the
MONOTONIC_CONCESSION_PROTOCOL was used, which was modified to allow the
use of more than two AGENTS. as a STRATEGY, the ZEUTHEN_STRATEGY for the
PROTOCOL was used, which was modified to allow the use of more than two
AGENTS, and also the choice of the AGREEMENT_OPTION for the conceding
AGENT for this STRATEGY was formalized. the agreement, the
UTILITY_FUNCTION and the risk of going into CONFLICT for the PROTOCOL
were formalized, which allows us to consider the DISTRIBUTION of tasks
between AGENTS as a modified ASSIGNMENT_PROBLEM, in which all AGENTS
should receive approximately the same income from solving problems. the
proposed approach can be used in various multi_agent systems for MODELING
negotiations.  copyright  2022 for this paper by ITS authors.

Abstract:
```
this RESEARCH_AIMS to prompt AGENTS to improve their strategies
initiatively in order to decrease CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS and
ENHANCE_GREEN_FACTORS during PRODUCTION and CONSUMPTION_PROCESSES. an
INCENTIVE_NEGOTIATION_MECHANISM is proposed for AGENTS in SUPPLY_CHAINS
to improve their strategies. MULTIPLE_ITEMS, MULTIPLE_ATTRIBUTES, and
MULTIPLE_ECHELONS are involved in the proposed MODEL. in addition, this
RESEARCH takes both the COMMERCE and the ENVIRONMENTAL_ATTRIBUTES into
account. the ENVIRONMENTAL_ATTRIBUTES were transformed into rewards or
penalty by setting REWARD_FACTORS or PENALTY_FACTORS, and were taken into
account during the calculation of the profits. the SIMULATION_RESULTS
show that the proposed MODEL was feasible to solve the
COMPLEX_NEGOTIATION_PROBLEMS, and had a GOOD_PERFORMANCE. the
GREEN_FACTORS of AGENTS in the green SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK are increased
when the AGENTS have LOW_INITIAL_GREEN_FACTORS. moreover, the proposed
MODEL can effectively reduce the CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS as well. the
proposed MODEL can be seen as a WINWIN_SOLUTION from the perspective of
both business and ENVIRONMENTAL_PROTECTION. the TOTAL_PROFIT of the green
SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK is improved, and the harm to the ENVIRONMENT is
decreased as well.  the author(s) 2020.

Title: orfe to AFEXA_CONCEPTUAL_LOOK into the future of ONLINE_FREIGHT_EXCHANGE
Abstract:
```
due to the steadily increasing FREIGHT_RATES it is being searched in
LOGISTICS for decades for methods to organize transports and their
COMMUNICATION within the framework of INTERNATIONAL_FREIGHT_TRAFFICS more
efficiently and sustainably. an idea emerging consistently in this
context is the more EFFICIENT_CONFIGURATION and COORDINATION of
MULTIMODAL_TRANSPORT_CHAINS whereby freights are being transported by
utilization of DIFFERENT_TRANSPORT_CARRIERS like e.g. ship, rail and
road. through a better intercommunication of the actors involved in a
TRANSPORT, also across DIFFERENT_TRANSPORT_CARRIERS, environmentally
HARMFUL_EMISSIONS shall be reduced in the midterm, the COSTS on
LONG_DISTANCES shall be lowered and INFORMATION_ASYMMETRIES in single
TRANSPORT_MARKETS shall be mitigated. different future_ and
innovation_oriented projects, like e.g. logfor, code24 and
CENTRAL_EUROPE, make efforts to achieve MEASURABLE_PROGRESS in this area.
within the framework of the CODE24_PROJECT the PROTOTYPE_ORFE of an
ONLINE_RAIL_FREIGHT_EXCHANGE has been developed at the institute for
PRODUCTION and INDUSTRIAL_INFORMATION_MANAGEMENT of the university of
duisburg_essen. it DEMONSTRATES_FUNCTIONALITIES for a more
TRANSPARENT_COMMUNICATION of AVAILABLE_TRANSPORT_SERVICES and also
supports the CONFIGURATION of multimodal SUPPLY_CHAINS. the
POSITIVE_FEEDBACK within and outside of the PROJECT_SHOWS the
ACTUAL_DEMAND for an ONLINE_SUPPORT of the SERVICE_PROCESSES within the
RAIL_FREIGHT_INDUSTRY. for instance, the establishment of the first
dedicated ONLINE_RAIL_FREIGHT_EXCHANGES in the year 2013 trace directly
back to the efforts of the PROJECT_PARTNERS within the CODE24_PROJECT.
while it remains to be seen whether the hereby established products can
permanently prove themselves on the MARKET, the presented PAPER_ARGUES
that SUCH_ONLINE_MARKETPLACES will be replaced by such with more
INNOVATIVE_APPROACHES in the LONG_RUN. for though the described concept
of an ONLINE_FREIGHT_EXCHANGE can reduce the non_transparency of single
TRANSPORT_MARKETS as well as the COSTS in case of
SUFFICIENT_PARTICIPATION, ITS way of communicating TRANSPORT_SERVICES
carries other problems: the PURE_CONTACTUAL_MEDIATION between
POTENTIAL_BUSINESS_PARTNERS requires a HIGH_CONFIDENCE in the
communicating institution and cannot, even in case of
BELIEVABLE_NEUTRALITY of the MARKETPLACE_OPERATOR, guarantee
contractually binding BUSINESS_TRANSACTIONS as these have to take place
outside of the ONLINE_FREIGHT_EXCHANGE after the CONTACT_INITIATION. from
the point of view of the authors, these CONTACT_EXCHANGES will be
replaced by agent_based FREIGHT_EXCHANGES in the LONG_RUN. such an
afex_system (agent_based FREIGHT_EXCHANGE) will provide a highly
automatized and interconnected marketplace which provides the possibility
for DECENTRALIZED and AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS to conclude independently a
contract that is optimal for them in a completely
TRANSPARENT_MARKET_ACTIVITY from their point of view. the contractual
binding AUCTION of MULTIMODAL_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT_SERVICES is made possible
through the application of a two_sided COMBINATORIAL_AUCTION_MODEL which
allows the AUCTION_PARTICIPANTS to submit offers and demands for
combinations of TRANSPORT_SERVICES that shall be realized by means of
DIFFERENT_TRANSPORT_CARRIERS. the paper at HAND_COMPARES the
PAST_RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENTAL_RESULTS on ONLINE_MARKETPLACES for the
COMMUNICATION of AVAILABLE_TRANSPORT_SERVICES like orfe with the
CONCEPTUAL_BASES as well as chosen PROTOTYPICAL_CHARACTERISTICS of the
sketched afex_system. finally, an outlook on prospective,
INNOVATIVE_CONCEPTS will be given which support the NEGOTIATION of
CONTRACTS for MULTIMODAL_TRANSPORT_SERVICES with multi_agent systems.

Title: automated NEGOTIATION_SYSTEM in the SCM with TRADE_OFF ALGORITHM
Abstract:
```
today, SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT is regarded as an
ESSENTIAL_STRATEGIC_FACTOR which has a great deal of influence on earning
COMPETITIVENESS in the abruptly changing GLOBAL_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT.
multi_agent TECHNOLOGY becomes the best candidate for PROBLEM_SOLVER
under these circumstances. in SCM, improving the EFFICIENCY of the
overall SUPPLY_CHAIN is of KEY_INTEREST. because of MARKET_GLOBALIZATION
and the advancement of e_commerce the importance of SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK
is increasing. a SUPPLY_CHAIN can produce products for MULTIPLE_MARKETS.
also, an INDIVIDUAL_COMPANY is likely to have only limited VISIBILITY of
the SUPPLY_CHAIN_STRUCTURE, which makes it difficult to make
FUTURE_DEMAND FORECAST, because the pattern of DEMAND_PROPAGATION through
the SUPPLY_CHAIN depends on the capabilities and strategies of COMPANIES
along the path from the markets to the company. there will be the
CONFLICT among the pursuit of the profit of all members of the SCM. in
order to maximize the TOTAL_PROFIT of the SCM, NEGOTIATION among all
members is necessary. the aim of this paper is to develop a
HEURISTIC_COMPUTATIONAL_MODEL of the trade_off STRATEGY and show that it
can be LEAD to an increased the profit of all members of the SCM. the
trade_off ALGORITHM is proposed in order to provide the total
MAXIMUM_PROFITS and the MINIMUM_DIFFERENCE in profits of both attendances
in negotiations. and multi_agent based automated NEGOTIATION_SYSTEM could
be transformed into LINEAR_PROGRAMMING with NEGOTIATION_INFORMATION. the
ideas behind the suggested MODEL are trade_off ALGORITHM with an AGENT
and we consider MULTIPLE_DECISION_VARIABLES that are color, price,

Title: automated NEGOTIATION_SYSTEM in the SCM with TRADE_OFF ALGORITHM
Abstract:
```
today, SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT is regarded as an
ESSENTIAL_STRATEGIC_FACTOR which has a great deal of influence on earning
COMPETITIVENESS in the abruptly changing GLOBAL_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT.
multi_agent TECHNOLOGY becomes the best candidate for PROBLEM_SOLVER
under these circumstances. in SCM, improving the EFFICIENCY of the
overall SUPPLY_CHAIN is of KEY_INTEREST. because of MARKET_GLOBALIZATION
and the advancement of e_commerce the importance of SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK
is increasing. a SUPPLY_CHAIN can produce products for MULTIPLE_MARKETS.
also, an INDIVIDUAL_COMPANY is likely to have only limited VISIBILITY of
the SUPPLY_CHAIN_STRUCTURE, which makes it difficult to make
FUTURE_DEMAND FORECAST, because the pattern of DEMAND_PROPAGATION through
the SUPPLY_CHAIN depends on the capabilities and strategies of COMPANIES
along the path from the markets to the company. there will be the
CONFLICT among the pursuit of the profit of all members of the SCM. in
order to maximize the TOTAL_PROFIT of the SCM, NEGOTIATION among all
members is necessary. the aim of this paper is to develop a
HEURISTIC_COMPUTATIONAL_MODEL of the trade_off STRATEGY and show that it
can be LEAD to an increased the profit of all members of the SCM. the
trade_off ALGORITHM is proposed in order to provide the total
MAXIMUM_PROFITS and the MINIMUM_DIFFERENCE in profits of both attendances
in negotiations. and multi_agent based automated NEGOTIATION_SYSTEM could
be transformed into LINEAR_PROGRAMMING with NEGOTIATION_INFORMATION. the
ideas behind the suggested MODEL are trade_off ALGORITHM with an AGENT
and we consider MULTIPLE_DECISION_VARIABLES that are color, price,
mileage, and DELIVERY_DATE. multi_agent based automated
NEGOTIATION_SYSTEM is compared with NEGOTIATION_SYSTEM with trade_off
mechanism. UTILITY_FUNCTION is used as a PERFORMANCE_MEASURE in order to
compare offer set that PURCHASING AGENT receipted. in this RESEARCH, only
PURCHASING AGENT and SUPPLIER_AGENT is considered. and multi_agent based
automated NEGOTIATION_SYSTEM is able to find the best
NEGOTIATION_STRATEGY that makes all members of the SCM satisfied in a
SIMPLE_SCM.  2015, avestia publishing. all rights reserved.

in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT, improving the EFFICIENCY of the overall
SUPPLY_CHAIN is of KEY_INTEREST. because of MARKET_GLOBALIZATION and the
advancement of e_commerce the importance of SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK is
increasing. a SUPPLY_CHAIN can produce products for MULTIPLE_MARKETS.
also, an INDIVIDUAL_COMPANY is likely to have only limited VISIBILITY of
the SUPPLY_CHAIN_STRUCTURE, which makes it difficult to make

through the SUPPLY_CHAIN depends on the capabilities and strategies of
COMPANIES along the path from the markets to the company. there will be
the CONFLICT among the pursuit of the profit of all members of the SCM.
in order to maximize the TOTAL_PROFIT of the SCM, NEGOTIATION among all
members is necessary. in this RESEARCH, we propose to find the best
NEGOTIATION_STRATEGY that makes all members of the SCM satisfied in a
SIMPLE_SCM. the ideas behind the suggested MODEL are
NEGOTIATION_ALGORITHM with an AGENT and we consider multiplefactors that
are price, REVIEW_POINT and DELIVERY_TIME. we create AGENTS with
JAVA_AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK and performed the SIMULATION under JADE
and ECLIPSE_ENVIRONMENT. we have used BENEFIT/COST ratio as a
PERFORMANCE_MEASURE in order to compare our SYSTEM with KASBAH_SYSTEM
that is a TYPICAL_SYSTEM well known to the world. users create
AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS that buy and sell goods on their behalf in the
KASBAH_SYSTEM.
