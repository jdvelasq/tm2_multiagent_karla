Title: a MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS approach for SUSTAINABLE_SUPPLIER_SELECTION and
ORDER_ALLOCATION in a partnership SUPPLY_CHAIN
Abstract:
```
recently, incorporating SUSTAINABILITY into the buyer_supplier sourcing
decisions has achieved a CONSIDERABLE_AMOUNT of attentions among
researchers and INDUSTRIAL_ENTERPRISES who are attempting to move towards
SUSTAINABLE_PRODUCTION. moreover, by investigating further in the
buyer_supplier relationships, the LITERATURE_SUGGESTS that
PROPER_COMMUNICATION and structured INFORMATION_EXCHANGE are
IMPORTANT_COMPONENTS in establishing a long_term partnership and
maintaining such a relationship. toward this end, a multi_agent systems
(MASS) approach is proposed as a mean of automating and facilitating the
PROCESS of SUSTAINABLE_SUPPLIER_SELECTION and ORDER_ALLOCATION (sss&oa)
resulting in a more co_operative partnership. this RESEARCH_SHOWS that
FINANCIAL_PERFORMANCE of MANUFACTURING COMPANIES adopting environmental
and SOCIAL_SUSTAINABILITY in their OPERATIONS_STRATEGY enhanced their
COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE that can LEAD to long_term sourcing relationships
for the buyer_supplier dyad. additionally, it was also shown that
applying MASS to the sss&OA_PROBLEM can be utilized as an approach to
FACILITATE_COMMUNICATIONS and AUTOMATE_INFORMATION_EXCHANGE_PROCESSES in
SUPPLY_CHAINS (scs) where SUPPLIERS and manufacturer are looking to
maintain a long_term SC partnership. the applicability of the developed
MAS_APPROACH and ITS incorporated SUSTAINABLE_SUPPLIER_EVALUATION and
ORDER_ALLOCATION_MODELS is demonstrated using an adopted
PRACTICAL_SCENARIO from an INDUSTRIAL_CASE_STUDY operating in the
ELECTRONICS_SECTOR in MEDICAL_DEVICE_INDUSTRY.  2017 elsevier b.v.

Title: INTEGRATED_MODELING of extended AGRO_FOOD SUPPLY_CHAINS: a
SYSTEMS_APPROACH
Abstract:
```
the CURRENT intense food production_consumption is one of the
MAIN_SOURCES of ENVIRONMENTAL_POLLUTION and contributes to
ANTHROPOGENIC_GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS. organic farming is a
POTENTIAL_WAY to reduce ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACTS by excluding
SYNTHETIC_PESTICIDES and FERTILIZERS from the PROCESS. despite
ECOLOGICAL_BENEFITS, it is unlikely that conversion to organic can be
financially viable for farmers, without ADDITIONAL_SUPPORT and incentives
from consumers. this STUDY_MODELS the interplay between
CONSUMER_PREFERENCES and socio_environmental issues related to
AGRICULTURE and FOOD_PRODUCTION. we operationalize the NOVEL_CONCEPT of
extended agro_food SUPPLY_CHAIN and SIMULATE_ADAPTIVE_BEHAVIOR of
farmers, FOOD_PROCESSORS, RETAILERS, and CUSTOMERS. not only the
OPERATIONAL_FACTORS (e.g., price, quantity, and LEAD_TIME), but also the
BEHAVIORAL_FACTORS (e.g., attitude, perceived CONTROL, SOCIAL_NORMS,
habits, and PERSONAL_GOALS) of the FOOD_SUPPLIERS and consumers are
considered in order to FOSTER_ORGANIC farming. we propose an
INTEGRATED_APPROACH combining agent_based, discrete_event, and
SYSTEM_DYNAMICS MODELING for a case of WINE SUPPLY_CHAIN. findings
demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed MODEL over
the traditional sustainable SUPPLY_CHAIN MODELS in incorporating the
FEEDBACK between consumers and producers and analyzing
MANAGEMENT_SCENARIOS that can URGE_FARMERS to expand ORGANIC_AGRICULTURE.
results further indicate that demand_side participation in
TRANSITION_PATHWAYS towards SUSTAINABLE_AGRICULTURE can become a
time_consuming effort if not accompanied by the MIDDLE_ACTORS between
consumers and farmers. in practice, our proposed MODEL may serve as a
decision_support tool to guide evidence_based policymaking in the food
and AGRICULTURE_SECTOR.  2020 elsevier b.v.

Title: the impact of the SUPPLY_CHAIN_STRUCTURE on BULLWHIP_EFFECT
Abstract:
```
the aim of this paper is to study how the STRUCTURAL_FACTORS of
SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS, (I.e. the number of echelons, the number of nodes
and the DISTRIBUTION of links) impact on ITS DYNAMICS_PERFORMANCE (I.e.
BULLWHIP_EFFECT). to do so, we systematically MODEL MULTIPLE_STRUCTURES
according to a ROBUST_DESIGN of EXPERIMENTS and simulate SUCH_STRUCTURES
under two DIFFERENT_MARKET_DEMAND_SCENARIOS. the former emulates a
STATIONARY_CONDITION of the MARKET, while the latter reproduce the
EXTREME_VOLATILITY and IMPETUOUS_ALTERATION of the MARKET produced by the
CURRENT_ECONOMIC_RECESSION. RESULTS_CONTRIBUTE to the SCIENTIFIC_DEBATE
on SUPPLY_CHAIN DYNAMICS by showing how the advocated number of echelons
is not the only STRUCTURAL_FACTOR that exacerbates the BULLWHIP_EFFECT.
in particular, under a SUDDEN_SHOCK in MARKET_DEMAND, the number of nodes
and the divergence of the SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK affect the
SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE.  2015 ELSEVIER_INC. all rights reserved.

Title: serial vs. divergent SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS: a COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS of the
BULLWHIP_EFFECT
Abstract:
```
the AMPLIFICATION of DEMAND_VARIATION in a SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK (scn) is
a well_known phenomenon called the BULLWHIP_EFFECT, which
CREATES_INEFFICIENCIES due to HIGH_VARIATION in the ORDER_QUANTITIES
placed between COMPANIES, leading to a flow of a larger number of units
than the ACTUAL_NEED, increasing stock and generating stock_outs. since
this phenomenon has been recognised as one of the MAIN_OBSTACLES for
improving SCN_PERFORMANCE, recently it has received a lot of attention by
SCN_MANAGERS and researchers. one of the most common
SIMPLIFYING_ASSUMPTIONS in the literature is to assume that the
SCN_ADOPTS a SERIAL_STRUCTURE. the PRESENT_WORK_ADDRESSES a
COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS of the BULLWHIP_EFFECT between a SERIAL_SCN and a
more COMPLEX_DIVERGENT_SCN. to do so, we analyse the response of both
scns under two DIFFERENT_INPUT_DEMANDS: a STATIONARY_DEMAND and an
IMPULSE_DEMAND. the results reveal that there are not
SIGNIFICANT_DIFFERENCES in terms of BULLWHIP_EFFECT between both scns for
a STATIONARY_DEMAND. nevertheless, we show how for a VIOLENT_DISTURBANCE
in CUSTOMER_DEMAND there is a great different between the two scns.  2013

Title: PRODUCT_TRANSPORTATION_DISTANCE based SUPPLIER_SELECTION in sustainable
SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK
Abstract:
```
SUPPLIER_SELECTION is a very IMPORTANT_DECISION for an ENTERPRISE to
realize a SUSTAINABLE_PRODUCTION. however, almost all works, which
concerned the ENVIRONMENTAL_ISSUES, focused on the SUPPLIER_SELECTION or
EVALUATION_METHODS, rather than an INCENTIVE_MECHANISM to urge the
participants to improve their decisions to reduce the harm to the
ENVIRONMENT. in this RESEARCH, not only the COMMERCIAL_FACTORS (price,
quantity, and LEAD_TIME), but also the ENVIRONMENT_FACTORS (GREEN_FACTORS
and CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS) of the SUPPLIERS are considered in order to
reduce the harm to the ENVIRONMENT (the CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS and the
use of the HARMFUL_MATERIALS). a PRODUCT_TRANSPORTATION_DISTANCE is
proposed for a product to record the TRANSPORTATION_DISTANCE from the
RAW_MATERIAL to be a FINAL_PRODUCT, and to be consumed by the consumers.
it is used to calculate the CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS during the
WHOLE_PROCESSES of the product. an INCENTIVE_MECHANISM is proposed to
force the participants to make GREENER_DECISIONS to reduce the
CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS and use GREEN_MATERIALS. NUMERICAL_CALCULATIONS
are provided to verify the feasibility and the superiority of the
proposed MODEL.  2016 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: distributed CONSENSUS_TRACKING CONTROL of chaotic MULTI_AGENT
SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK: a new fault tolerant, finite time, and chatter free
approach
Abstract:
```
over the last years, distributed CONSENSUS_TRACKING CONTROL has received
a lot of attention due to ITS benefits, such as LOW_OPERATIONAL_COSTS,
HIGH_RESILIENCE, FLEXIBLE_SCALABILITY, and so on. however,
CONTROL_METHODS that do not consider faults in actuators and
CONTROL_AGENTS are impractical in most systems. there is no RESEARCH in
the literature investigating the CONSENSUS_TRACKING of
SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS subject to disturbances and faults in
CONTROL_INPUT. motivated by this, the CURRENT_RESEARCH_STUDIES the
fault_tolerant, finite_time, and SMOOTH_CONSENSUS tracking problems for
chaotic multi_agent SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS subject to disturbances,
uncertainties, and faults in actuators. the CHAOTIC_ATTRACTORS of a
SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK are shown, and ITS corresponding multi_agent SYSTEM
is presented. a NEW_CONTROL_TECHNIQUE is then proposed, which is suitable
for distributed CONSENSUS_TRACKING of nonlinear UNCERTAIN_SYSTEMS. in the
proposed scheme, the effects of faults in CONTROL_ACTUATORS and
ROBUSTNESS against unknown time_varying disturbances are taken into
account. the proposed TECHNIQUE also uses a finite_time super_twisting
ALGORITHM that avoids chattering in the SYSTEMS_RESPONSE and
CONTROL_INPUT. lastly, the multi_agent SYSTEM is considered in the
presence of disturbances and ACTUATOR_FAULTS, and the proposed schemes
EXCELLENT_PERFORMANCE is displayed through NUMERICAL_SIMULATIONS.  2021

Abstract:
```
ELECTRIFICATION is a POTENTIAL_SOLUTION for TRANSPORT_DECARBONIZATION and
already widely available for individual and PUBLIC_TRANSPORT. however,
the availability of electrified COMMERCIAL_VEHICLES like
WASTE_COLLECTION_VEHICLES is still limited, despite their
SIGNIFICANT_CONTRIBUTION to URBAN_EMISSIONS. moreover, there is a lack of
clarity whether ELECTRIC_WASTE_COLLECTION_VEHICLES can persist in
REAL_WORLD_CONDITIONS and which SYSTEM_DESIGN is required. therefore, we
introduce a multi_agent_based SIMULATION_METHODOLOGY to investigate the
TECHNICAL_FEASIBILITY and evaluate environmental and
ECONOMIC_SUSTAINABILITY of an electrified URBAN_WASTE_COLLECTION. we
present a SYNTHETIC_MODEL for WASTE_COLLECTION_DEMAND on a per_link
basis, using OPEN_AVAILABLE_DATA. the TOUR_PLANNING is solved by an
open_source ALGORITHM as a capacitated VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM (cvrp).
this GENERATES_PLAUSIBLE_TOURS which handle the DEMAND. the generated
tours are simulated with an open_source TRANSPORT SIMULATION (matsim) for
both the diesel and the ELECTRIC_WASTE_COLLECTION_VEHICLES. to compare
the LIFE_CYCLE_COSTS, we analyze the data using TOTAL_COST of ownership
(tco). ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACTS are evaluated based on a well_to_wheel
approach. we present a comparison of the two PROPULSION_TYPES for the
EXEMPLARY_USE_CASE of berlin. and we are able to generate a suitable
PLANNING to handle BERLINS_WASTE_COLLECTION_DEMAND using battery
ELECTRIC_VEHICLES only. the TCO_CALCULATION_REVEALS that the
ELECTRIFICATION_RAISES the TOTAL_OPERATOR_COST by 1630%, depending on the
scenario and the BATTERY_SIZE with CONSERVATIVE_ASSUMPTIONS. furthermore,
the GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS (ghg) can be reduced by 6099%, depending on

Title: SUPPLY_CHAIN information COLLABORATIVE SIMULATION_MODEL integrating

Abstract:
```
SUPPLY_CHAIN_COLLABORATION MANAGEMENT is a system_atic, integrated and
agile advanced MANAGEMENT_MODE, which helps to improve the
COMPETITIVENESS of ENTERPRISES and the entire SUPPLY_CHAIN. in order to
realise the synergy of SUPPLY_CHAIN, the most important is to realise the
DYNAMIC_SYNERGY of information. here we proposed a STRATEGY to integrate
SYSTEM_DYNAMICS and multi_agent SYSTEM MODELLING methods. based on the
STRATEGY of SUPPLY_CHAIN INFORMATION_SHARING and COORDINATION, a
two_level aggregation HYBRID_MODEL was designed and established. through
the COMPUTER_SIMULATION_ANALYSIS of the two modes before and after
INFORMATION_COLLABORATION, it is found that under the
INFORMATION_COLLABORATION_MODE, the CHANGE_TREND of order or INVENTORY of
SUPPLIERS and MANUFACTURERS always closely matches that of RETAILERS.
after the implementation of SUPPLY_CHAIN INFORMATION_COORDINATION,
ordering and INVENTORY can be reasonably planned and matched, and
problems such as over_stocking or short_term failure to meet
ORDER_DEMANDS caused by POOR_INFORMATION_COMMUNICATION will no longer
occur, which can greatly reduce the BULLWHIP_EFFECT.  2022, faculty of

investigate two SERVICE_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES in the GAME_THEORY_MODEL:
the MANUFACTURER_INVESTMENT and the e_tailer INVESTMENT. our
ANALYSIS_REVEALS that there are two INVESTMENT_CASES in the SUPPLY_CHAIN:
one member intends to the SERVICE_INVESTMENT (a win_win situation) and
neither is willing to offer the service (a lose_lose dilemma). then we
extend the THEORY_MODEL. the impacts of
CONSUMER_PREFERENCE_HETEROGENEITY, DEMAND_UNCERTAINTY and
CONSUMER_PREFERENCE for the PRODUCT_QUALITY_DIFFERENCE on the
INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES are explored by the method of multi_agent
MODELLING. we find that: (I) when CONSUMER_PREFERENCE_HETEROGENEITY is
small, the e_tailer should invest in the service; (ii) if
CONSUMER_PREFERENCE or DEMAND_UNCERTAINTY is moderate, it is difficult to
reach an agreement between two players. further, the
GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDY_FACTOR is considered. the issue of how the
GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDY_AFFECTS_SERVICE_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES is discussed. in
fact, it is not necessary to provide a subsidy all the time. only when

Title: MULTI_AGENT_FRAMEWORK for MANUFACTURING SUSTAINABILITY_ANALYSIS and
OPTIMIZATION
Abstract:
```
MANUFACTURING_SUSTAINABILITY is related to COMPLEX_ADAPTIVE_SYSTEMS
crossing DIFFERENT_LAYERS; SUSTAINABILITY_ISSUES, and their
POTENTIAL_RESOLUTIONS, are transversal to SUPPLY and shop_floor levels,
often including INTERACTION between them; in addition, MULTIPLE_ACTORS
across the SUPPLY_CHAIN_INTERACT displaying non_linear and non_rational
behaviours characterized by feedbacks and TIME_LAGS. this COMPLEXITY is
nowadays addressed with CLASSICAL_SIMULATION_APPROACHES such as
SYSTEM_DYNAMICS (sd), DYNAMIC_SYSTEMS (ds) at very high and
AGGREGATE_LEVEL, or DISCRETE_EVENT_SIMULATION (DES) at very low and
disaggregated level. AGENT_BASED_MODELLING (abm) approach may potentially
address SUCH_ISSUES in a more EFFECTIVE_WAY because it exploits the
strengths of both aggregated and disaggregated MODELS, while minimizing
the drawbacks. the purpose of this paper is to present a self_developed
multi_agent based framework as a basis for sustainable MANUFACTURING
MODELLING, SIMULATION and analysis. a LITERATURE_REVIEW on
AGENT_BASED_MODELLING applied to sustainable MANUFACTURING issues is
reported to justify choices adopted in the developed tool. then an
ILLUSTRATIVE_CASE of a semi_automated FOOD_PRODUCTION_LINE is described
with the aim of evaluating the self_developed framework through some
SUSTAINABILITY and PRODUCTIVITY_KPIS, and showing easiness and
ADAPTABILITY. the COMPLETE_AGENT based simulator and the
INTERACTION_SEQUENCE are reported and validated by an
EXPERIMENTAL_CAMPAIGN.  springer international publishing ag 2017.

Title: a NOVEL_COORDINATION_MECHANISM to coordinate the MULTI_AGENT reverse
SUPPLY_CHAIN with FAIRNESS_CONCERNS
Abstract:
```
in the RECYCLING INDUSTRY, reverse SUPPLY_CHAIN (rsc) MANAGEMENT with
used and end_of_life product collection and REMANUFACTURING has an
IMPORTANT_ROLE to play with respect to improving
ENVIRONMENTAL_SUSTAINABILITY. such a rsc is generally composed of more
than two HETEROGENOUS_AGENTS such that the existing CONTRACTS in the
literature fail to coordinate it. besides, as long as one of these AGENTS
makes PROFIT_COMPARISONS and EXHIBITS_FAIRNESS concerns, it would further
complicate this COORDINATION_PROBLEM. in this paper, we develop a biform
game_based COORDINATION_MECHANISM, combining the non_cooperative and
COOPERATIVE_GAMES, to coordinate a multi_agent rsc with one
remanufacturer and two COMPETITION_COLLECTORS, where one of the
collectors has DISTRIBUTIONAL_FAIRNESS concerns. applying the
game_theoretic and NUMERICAL_ANALYSES, we obtain the following results:
(1) our proposed methods accomplish the COORDINATION in the sense that
all the RSC_AGENTS are better off than in the case of the non_cooperative
GAME. (2) we identify the conditions under which the fairness_minded
collector would achieve FAIR_OUTCOMES in the BIFORM_GAME, as is the case
for the non_cooperative GAME. (3) in contrast to the non_cooperative GAME
case, the BIFORM_GAME_MECHANISM_RESOLVES the impact of FAIRNESS_CONCERNS
on the RECYCLING channel to a CERTAIN_EXTENT, as both the
COALITION_EXTERNALITIES and biform game_based CONTRACTS make it more
compatible across all RSC_AGENTS. our MAIN_CONTRIBUTIONS are the adoption
of NOVEL_BIFORM_GAMES combined with BEHAVIORAL_ECONOMICS_FACTORS to study
the COORDINATION_CHALLENGE of multi_agent rsc with collector'S
FAIRNESS_CONCERNS.  2023 elsevier b.v.

Title: on the EVALUATION of arborescent SUPPLY_CHAINS with INVENTORY_ERRORS
Abstract:
```
this PAPER_ADDRESSES the impact of INVENTORY_ERRORS on the PERFORMANCE of
arborescent SUPPLY_CHAINS, characterized by the BULLWHIP_EFFECT. the
INVENTORY_RECORDS_INACCURACY is caused by a PERMANENT_SHRINKAGE.
PERIODIC_INVENTORY_AUDITS are used to CONTROL the consequences of the
INVENTORY_RECORDS_INACCURACY_PHENOMENON. DIFFERENT_LEVELS of SHRINKAGE
and DIFFERENT_FREQUENCY of audits are considered in the analysis. the
PERFORMANCE of the arborescent SUPPLY_CHAIN is compared with the
PERFORMANCE of a CLASSICAL_SERIAL SUPPLY_CHAIN in order to provide
BENCHMARKING. data is obtained through multi_agent SIMULATION. results
show that the impact of INVENTORY_RECORDS_INACCURACY on the
BULLWHIP_EFFECT is higher in the arborescent SUPPLY_CHAIN: (1) the
arborescent SUPPLY_CHAIN is more vulnerable to INVENTORY_SHRINKAGE than
the serial SUPPLY_CHAIN, and (2) the adoption of
PERIODIC_INVENTORY_AUDITS is more beneficial in terms of
BULLWHIP_REDUCTION in the arborescent SUPPLY_CHAIN than the serial
SUPPLY_CHAIN.  2015 INTERNATIONAL_INSTITUTE for INNOVATION,

Abstract:
```
the multi_agent_based SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK is a DYNAMIC_SYSTEM consisting
of MULTIPLE_SUBCHAINS connected by INFORMATION_FLOWS, material flows and

this paper mainly considers the fixed_time CONSENSUS of a stochastic
three_echelon multi_agent_based SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM. a nonlinear FEEDBACK
fixed_time CONTROL_PROTOCOL is constructed for ensuring the CONSENSUS of
the considered SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK. using the STABILITY_THEORY of
STOCHASTIC_DIFFERENTIAL_EQUATIONS, SUFFICIENT_CONDITIONS for the
fixed_time CONSENSUS and the upper bound ESTIMATION of the settling time
are obtained. finally, the validity of the CONTROL_PROTOCOL and the

Title: effectiveness of a MULTI_AGENT COOPERATION GAME in a MULTI_STAGE
SUPPLY_CHAIN  BEER_GAME experiment
Abstract:
```
in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT, the BULLWHIP_EFFECT leads to an increase in
COSTS and OPPORTUNITY_LOSS_RISK, and imposes a SIGNIFICANT_BURDEN on
COMPANY_MANAGEMENT. therefore, controlling the BULLWHIP_EFFECT in the
SUPPLY_CHAIN is an IMPORTANT_ISSUE. the COMMON_STRATEGY and
INFORMATION_SHARING among COMPANIES are effective in reducing the
BULLWHIP_EFFECT. these effects have been shown in many studies. however,
in RECENT_YEARS, in the increasingly complex SUPPLY_CHAIN, it is very
difficult for each company to have an accurate and TIMELY_UNDERSTANDING
of the information that affects their actions. this makes it difficult to
SHARE_INFORMATION and COMMON_STRATEGIES throughout the SUPPLY_CHAIN. this
STUDY_CONSIDERS a MODEL of COOPERATION between some COMPANIES in the
SUPPLY_CHAIN to SHARE_INFORMATION and COMMON_STRATEGIES. studies that aim
to reduce the BULLWHIP_EFFECT and the TOTAL_COST in the SUPPLY_CHAINS
involve DEMAND_FORECASTING, INVENTORY_POLICY and
SAFETY_STOCK_OPTIMIZATION. the proposed MODEL_FOCUSES on improving
COMPANY_STRATEGIES by combining MULTIPLE_STRATEGIES and analyzes which
POLICIES and actions improve the PERFORMANCE of the entire SUPPLY_CHAIN.
in this study, a multi_stage SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL is constructed using
multi_agent SIMULATION to identify the OPTIMAL_STRATEGY by analyzing the
effect of COOPERATION between COMPANIES in terms of the BULLWHIP_EFFECT
and the TOTAL_COST. this STUDY_IDENTIFIES a tendency for an the
OPTIMAL_STRATEGY to be used by each company. in addition, the results
will be validated by a BEER_GAME_DEMONSTRATION to examine
EFFECTIVE_STRATEGIES in a real SUPPLY_CHAIN.  2023 JAPAN

Title: the effect of REPLENISHMENT_POLICY on BULLWHIP_EFFECT considering the
higher level shipments
Abstract:
```
a multi_level and multi_node SUPPLY_CHAIN multi_agent SIMULATION_MODEL is
established based on the two
MAXIMUM_INVENTORY_LEVEL_REPLENISHMENT_STRATEGIES, which consider the
SUPERIOR_SHIPMENTS. the effect of these two REPLENISHMENT_STRATEGIES on
the BULLWHIP_EFFECT of SUPPLY_CHAIN role level and ENTERPRISE_NODE is
discussed. this paper describes in detail how the
SUPPLY_CHAIN_ENTERPRISES deal with IMPORTANT_ISSUES such as, receipt from
superior, SUBORDINATE_DELIVERY, and order to the higher level. what is
more important is that how to carry out DEMAND_FORECASTING and
REPLENISHMENT using the MAXIMUM_INVENTORY_LEVEL_STRATEGY when ordering to
the superiors. results show that the BULLWHIP effects on the other three
kinds of scenarios are all different from those with a higher quantity of
goods, which the BULLWHIP_EFFECT is not notable. the BULLWHIP_EFFECT
significantly increases from downstream to upstream. in the DEVELOPMENT
of REPLENISHMENT_STRATEGY, compared to not considering the
SUPERIOR_SHIPMENTS, considering it will significantly reduce the
LAYER_BULLWHIP_EFFECT and NODE_BULLWHIP_EFFECT of the AGENTS in
SUPPLY_CHAIN. considering the SUPERIOR_SHIPMENTS has brought
BENEFICIAL_IMPACT to the ORDER_QUANTITY_STABILITY of each layer and the

Title: fostering COLLABORATION and COORDINATION in URBAN_DELIVERY: a MULTI_AGENT
MICROSIMULATION MODEL
Abstract:
```
given the DYNAMIC_NATURE of URBAN_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT (uft) processes, the
involved TRANSPORT and LOGISTICS_OPERATORS face with internal and
EXTERNAL_ISSUES that should tackle to improve last_mile levels of service
and decrease TOTAL_COSTS while performing DELIVERY_OPERATIONS. CUSTOMERS
(I.e., FREIGHT_RECEIVERS) perceive the level of service through the
acceptance of their requests, while TOTAL_OPERATIONAL_COSTS are mainly
determined by the TOTAL_TRAVEL_COSTS (I.e., distance and/or time)
required to accomplish the CUSTOMERS' request. in addition, the
vehicle_kilometres travelled are related to the externalities produced.
given that the actors involved in the PROCESS operate in a
STOCHASTIC_ENVIRONMENT (with changes that can occur both in terms of
DEMAND  receivers' requests, and in SUPPLY  TRAVEL_TIMES), COLLABORATION
and COORDINATION among the operators could play a KEY_ROLE in meeting the
CUSTOMERS' requests as well as in reducing both internal and
EXTERNAL_DELIVERY_COSTS. therefore, the paper proposes an uft MODELLING
framework that INTEGRATES_COLLABORATION and COORDINATION_PROCESSES among
the different involved actors, and allows the benefits to be assessed.
the MODEL has a multi_agent ARCHITECTURE based on MICROSIMULATION. in
particular, the multi_agent ARCHITECTURE allows us to point out the
DIFFERENT_ACTORS_RESPONSES to various internal (e.g., DELIVERY_REQUESTS)
and external (e.g., DELIVERY_TIMES) changes occurring in the
DAILY_DELIVERY_OPERATIONS. it consists of three LAYERS. the first one
simulates the INTERACTIONS among actors operating collaboratively. the
second LAYER_MICROSIMULATES the COLLABORATIVE_PROCESSES of
INFORMATION_MANAGEMENT. finally, a third LAYER_INTEGRATES the two
PREVIOUS_LAYERS, facilitating a decision_making PROCESS in such a
DYNAMIC_CONTEXT. the whole MODELLING framework is tested in a
REAL_CASE_STUDY in which it is possible to VALIDATE_PROS and cons of
working in a COLLABORATIVE and COORDINATIVE_ENVIRONMENT. the results show
SIGNIFICANT_BENEFITS from actors/operators involved in the PROCESS and
subsequently can address the POLICY/measure implementation towards a more
sustainable and LIVEABLE_CITY.  2023 the authors

[OBJECTIVE] this STUDY_INTRODUCES the back_feeding mechanism, considers
the BENEFIT of back feeding for PAPER_MAKING and MARKETING subjects to
FOREST_MANAGEMENT_SUBJECTS, and explores a NEW_PATH of
EFFECTIVE_BENEFIT_DISTRIBUTION and STABLE_SYMBIOTIC_DEVELOPMENT of a
green SUPPLY_CHAIN for forest to the paper.[method] based on the THEORY
of SYSTEM_DYNAMICS, the forest to the PAPER_GREEN SUPPLY_CHAIN is built
as a COOPERATION_ALLIANCE, and the CAUSALITY_DIAGRAM is drawn, with
RELEVANT_VARIABLES extracted, the SYSTEM_FLOW_DIAGRAM drawn, the values
of RELEVANT_VARIABLES calculated and the VARIABLE_EQUATION designed.
MULTIPLE_BENEFIT_FEEDBACK_PROPORTION_SCHEMES are designed, and the
CHANGE_TREND of the overall and INDIVIDUAL_BENEFITS of the forest to the
PAPER_GREEN SUPPLY_CHAIN are analyzed through a DYNAMIC_MODEL_SIMULATION.
[result] under the BENEFIT_FEEDBACK_SCHEMES, the overall economic,
ecological, and INDIVIDUAL_BENEFITS of the forest to PAPER_GREEN
SUPPLY_CHAIN were higher than those of the non_feedback scheme. from the
perspective of INDIVIDUAL_BENEFITS, it is preferable to choose the fixed
PROPORTION_I_SCHEME in which papermaking and other ENTITIES_FEED back the
SUSTAINABLE_ELEMENTS of 10% of the SYMBIOTIC_INCOME of the
FOREST_MANAGEMENT_ENTITIES annually, rather than the VARIABLE_I (20%,
16%, 12%, 8%, 4%) PROPORTION_SCHEME, in which papermaking and other
ENTITIES_FEED back the FOREST_MANAGEMENT_ENTITIES annually, and the
proportion of back_feeding is low. from the perspective of
OVERALL_BENEFITS, the scheme of VARIABLE_PROPORTION_II (30%, 25%, 20%,
15%, 10%) is preferred, where the proportion of back_feeding of
papermaking and other entities to the MAIN_BODY of
FOREST_MANAGEMENT_CHANGES annually, and the proportion of back_feeding is
high.[conclusion]the back_feeding scheme is better than the non
back_feeding scheme. from the perspective of the OVERALL_BENEFITS of the
green SUPPLY_CHAIN for forest to paper, the higher the proportion of
back_feeding, the greater the BENEFIT. from the perspective of the
INDIVIDUAL_BENEFITS of the green SUPPLY_CHAIN, when the back_feeding
proportion is close to the scenario, the variable_proportion scheme is
better than the fixed_proportion scheme. from the perspective of the
INDIVIDUAL_BENEFITS, the proportion of back_feeding should not be too
high. while selecting a scheme, the CORE_ENTERPRISE takes the LEAD, and
MULTIPLE_SUBJECTS participate in the discussion to select a

Title: MULTI_AGENT CONTROL of periodic REVIEW SUPPLY_CHAIN
Abstract:
```
the BULLWHIP_EFFECT is one of the most IMPORTANT_REASONS for reducing the
PERFORMANCE of the SUPPLY_CHAIN (SC) and imposes many COSTS on the
INDUSTRY. VARIOUS_REASONS cause the BULLWHIP_EFFECT (bwe), the most
important of which are IMPROPER_CLASSIFICATION of orders or
PERIODIC_REVIEWS. this paper first proposed the STATE_SPACE_MODEL of a
SUPPLY_CHAIN with a PERIODIC_REVIEW_POLICY. we indicated that by
categorizing and TIMING_ORDERS periodically with the concepts of
SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT, we reach a three_agent structure with a t_order
(cycle of orders). the INTERACTION of the AGENTS in this MODEL has a
SPANNING_TREE, so it was shown that the three_agent approach with t_order
can efficiently send optimal PERIODIC_ORDERS to regulate and
STABILIZE_DEMAND_FLUCTUATIONS. the AGENTS moved to an agreed
INVENTORY_LEVEL by maintaining a CERTAIN_DISTANCE from their INVENTORY
with other AGENTS to adjust the bwe (an example of swarming in
multi_agent CONTROL). due to the existence of STORAGE_COSTS and the
DEMAND_FORECASTING that the PRODUCTION_AGENT_ADOPTS as the leader, a
prohibited level of INVENTORY, should be taken into account, and AGENTS
should avoid these levels. this problem was solved using the discussion
of avoiding obstacles in multi_agent CONTROL. finally, the EFFICIENCY of
the proposed method was probed by simulating and expressing the
equivalence of concepts, such as position, speed, and acceleration with
variables of INITIAL_INVENTORY, PRODUCTION, and PRODUCTION_RATE.  the

CRITICAL_PRODUCTS are essential for sustaining the well_being of people
and ensuring the continuity of critical society_serving OPERATIONS. in
the event of a disruption, the SUPPLY_CHAINS for these products are the
most affected, often exhibiting HUGE_DEMAND_SURGES coupled with
HIGH_WORKFORCE and SUPPLY scarcity and UNCERTAINTY. in the first part of
the paper, we present the synthesis of our ACTION_RESEARCH at
GEORGIA_TECH during the covid_19 PANDEMIC on the DESIGN, implementation,
OPERATION, and CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT of an INNOVATIVE_SYSTEM for
enabling the efficient, seamless, and resilient SUPPLY and DISTRIBUTION
of PERSONAL_PROTECTION_EQUIPMENT. featuring a distributed network of
SOFTWARE_AGENTS capable of AUTONOMOUS_PREDICTION and DECISION, and
incepted with human_centric OPERATIONS, our SYSTEM notably served
researchers on campus throughout the PANDEMIC with no STOCKOUT_INSTANCES
and negligible URGENT_REQUESTS from users. in the second part of the
paper, we build on this ACTION_RESEARCH to propose an end_to_end systemic
approach for the DISTRIBUTION of CRITICAL_SUPPLIES combining
AUTONOMOUS_OPERATIONS and hyperconnectivity in line with
PHYSICAL_INTERNET (pi, ) concepts. we notably combine the usage of smart,
eco_friendly, and MODULAR_CONTAINERS to protect CRITICAL_PRODUCTS and
ease handling; VISION_SENSORS and SMART_DISPENSERS to monitor and
CONTROL_CONSUMPTION; and AUTONOMOUS_TECHNOLOGIES such as DRONES, droids,
ROBOTS, and SMART_LOCKERS to ENABLE_EFFICIENT_TOUCHLESS_DISTRIBUTION. we
explore the impact of OPERATIONAL_AUTONOMY on the SUPPLY_CHAIN, discuss

Title: HCONSENSUS of MULTIAGENT based SUPPLY_CHAIN systems with
ZERO_SUM_GRAPHICAL_GAME theoretic method
Abstract:
```
SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM (scs) is NETWORK_CONTROL_SYSTEM composed of several
SUBCHAINS, each subchain in scs has COMPUTATION_INTELLIGENCE and
INFORMATION_INTERACTION_CAPABILITY could be described as an AGENT. such
that the scs could be modeled as MULTIAGENT_SYSTEM. investigating H
leader_follower CONSENSUS problem could solve the PRODUCT_QUANTITY
matching problem and attenuate the BULLWHIP_EFFECT caused by
UNCERTAIN_MARKET_DEMAND, which is considerable to improve
SYSTEM_PERFORMANCE for scs. in the framework of zero_sum graphical GAME,
PRODUCTION_RATE and UNCERTAIN_MARKET_DEMAND as GAME_PLAYERS_FORM a
CONFRONTATION_RELATIONSHIP. the OPTIMAL_PRODUCTION_RATE and worst_case
UNCERTAIN_MARKET_DEMAND related to zero_sum graphical GAME_SOLUTION could
be obtained at NASH_EQUILIBRIUM. due to acquire GAME_SOLUTION depends on
solving coupled hamilton_jacobi_isaacs (hji) equation, the
VALUE_ITERATION_ALGORITHM is introduced and the actor_critic_disturbance
NEURAL_NETWORK structure is presented for approximating GAME_SOLUTION,
OPTIMAL_PRODUCTION_RATE and worst_case UNCERTAIN_MARKET_DEMAND. lastly, a
NUMERICAL_SIMULATION and RESULT_ANALYSIS are provided to prove the
effectiveness of adopted method.  2021 TECHNICAL_COMMITTEE on

Title: impact of combined DEMAND_FORECASTING on the BULLWHIP_EFFECT and the
TOTAL_COST in a DECENTRALIZED SUPPLY_CHAIN
Abstract:
```
in this RESEARCH, a distributed SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL is constructed using a
multi_agent SYSTEM, and the OPTIMAL_COMBINATION of DEMAND_FORECASTING of
each company in the SUPPLY_CHAIN is analyzed. PERFORMANCE_EVALUATION is
evaluated not only in terms of BULLWHIP_EFFECT but also in terms of
TOTAL_COST. the SIMULATION_RESULTS show that each company can reduce the
BULLWHIP_EFFECT and the TOTAL_COST by determining the DEMAND_FORECASTING
method according to ITS position in the SUPPLY_CHAIN.   2020 ieee.

Title: an EXPLORATORY_STUDY on the implementation of INFORMATION_SHARING among
HETEROGENEOUS_RETAILERS
Abstract:
```
INFORMATION_SHARING among SUPPLY_CHAIN partners is known to have a
POSITIVE_EFFECT on SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE, reducing SUPPLY_CHAIN
inefficiencies and the BULLWHIP_EFFECT. however, modern DECENTRALIZED
SUPPLY_CHAINS present NUMEROUS_BARRIERS and difficulties to successfully
implement SUCH_COORDINATION_PRACTICE in the entire SUPPLY_CHAIN, often
achieving an INTERMEDIATE_STATE or PARTIAL_INFORMATION SHARING. in this
scenario, the presence of COMPANIES which are operationally heterogeneous
may increase these difficulties, since it is not clear in the
RESEARCH_LITERATURE how to proceed in order to select the best partners
to SHARE_INFORMATION with. in this paper we analyse the implementation of
PARTIAL_INFORMATION SHARING on a multi_echelon SUPPLY_CHAIN with
HETEROGENEOUS_RETAILERS. we show how the selection of RETAILERS for
PARTIAL_INFORMATION SHARING has a RELEVANT_IMPACT on reducing the
BULLWHIP_EFFECT, in particular for HIGH_LEVEL of RETAILERS'
HETEROGENEITY.

Title: FUZZY_RISK_ANALYSIS using FUZZY sampling method: CASE_STUDY of DESIGN a
RECONFIGURABLE MULTI_AGENT SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK under risk
Abstract:
```
first step of RECONFIGURABLE SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK developing is
understanding of RISK_AFFECTS. categorizing of RISK_MODULE and results of
RISK_EVENTS considered with gathering and analyzing of data from
NETWORK_DESIGN_PARAMETERS. these obtained data have
PROBABILITY_DISTRIBUTION that SHOWS_UNCERTAINTY in parameters. in the
literatures SUPPLY_CHAIN risk categorized based on occurrences rate or
frequency and period or DURATION_TIME and also place of occurrence. deal
with UNCERTAINTY and COMPLEXITY of risk, our proposed FUZZY_METHOD can
solve these problems in two aspects. also described a FUZZY based
sampling method (flhs) that developed and used in this paper can improve
our results even more than PREVIOUS_WORKS. this PAPER_SUGGESTS a novel
MODELLING and SIMULATION_METHOD of FUZZY sampling and
FUZZY_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM to address the DYNAMIC_RISKS effects in the
especially the consideration of UNCERTAINTY_RISK_EVENT_SYSTEM_BEHAVIOR in
DIFFERENT_OPERATIONAL_CONDITIONS.  2017 kiie
