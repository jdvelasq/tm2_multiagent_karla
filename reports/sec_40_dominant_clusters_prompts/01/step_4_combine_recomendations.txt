PARAGRAPHS TO COMBINE:

Practitioners aiming to implement MARL and related learning systems should begin with pilot applications in domains where agent coordination yields clear cost-performance benefits—such as collaborative drone delivery or vehicle routing in urban logistics [UT 373, UT 424]. Initial deployments should favor hybrid learning strategies that integrate heuristics for faster convergence and greater control over emergent agent behavior [UT 403, UT 383]. Managers should prioritize modular frameworks that enable simulation-based validation of agent policies under various scenarios, including inventory disruptions and dynamic order influx [UT 389, UT 443]. When operating in sustainability-sensitive sectors, such as hydrogen distribution or natural gas networks, companies should embed environmental constraints into learning objectives, leveraging hierarchical MARL to balance economic performance with regulatory compliance [UT 417, UT 400]. It is essential to incorporate risk sensitivity and robustness into agent training, ensuring agents can adapt not only to changing data but also to systemic shocks and cross-agent strategy shifts [UT 389, UT 392]. To facilitate trust and interpretability, decision outputs should be coupled with visualization or explanation interfaces that allow human supervisors to audit and intervene in agent actions when needed. Finally, managers should align team structures and IT systems to support continuous learning and data flow integration, thereby enabling the adaptive evolution of learning agents alongside shifting market and operational realities.

Managers should prioritize the adoption of MARL systems that incorporate context-aware decision-making and real-time optimization capabilities. This is especially relevant in last-mile logistics, where communication-enhanced multi-agent frameworks have demonstrated superior performance in dynamic delivery environments [UT 420]. Practitioners are encouraged to explore privacy-preserving architectures to facilitate secure inter-company coordination in inventory and supply chain planning, thus overcoming the traditional reluctance to share sensitive data [UT 438]. When optimizing vehicle routing or delivery networks, managers should consider reinforcement learning-based path-sharing mechanisms, which outperform traditional point-to-point strategies in both distance and fleet utilization [UT 431]. In manufacturing, the deployment of systematic and heuristic multi-agent scheduling methods can help firms address disruptions and uncertainties, particularly under political or labor constraints [UT 425]. Firms involved in the digital transformation of supply chains should invest in agent-driven simulation and optimization tools that not only manage operational decisions but also support scenario evaluation and strategic planning [UT 446]. Moreover, supply chain leaders must embrace hybrid approaches combining heuristics and learning systems, such as genetic algorithms with RL, to improve the adaptability and resilience of their operations in the face of uncertainty [UT 397, UT 440]. Investing in such technologies not only enhances current performance but also positions firms at the forefront of the intelligent supply chain revolution.

For practitioners seeking to adopt multi-agent systems in supply chains, several strategic recommendations emerge. First, managers should prioritize *modular MAS architectures* that allow for the incremental deployment of agent functions, starting with tasks like *inventory control* or *last-mile delivery*, where rapid gains in responsiveness and cost efficiency are demonstrable [UT 302, UT 323]. Emphasizing *data infrastructure readiness* is crucial—systems should be capable of supporting high-frequency data inputs for real-time learning and decision-making, especially in *urban logistics* and *dynamic order environments* [UT 206]. Practitioners are encouraged to adopt hybrid approaches combining *heuristic-based algorithms* and *reinforcement learning* to balance exploration and exploitation, particularly under uncertain and changing market conditions [UT 293, UT 148]. In sustainability-oriented settings, aligning MAS configurations with *green performance metrics* and leveraging *incentive negotiation mechanisms* can foster competitive yet environmentally conscious behaviors [UT 214]. Importantly, simulation platforms should be used not just for design validation but as continuous learning environments, where *agents are trained* on historical and predictive scenarios to adapt strategies iteratively [UT 276]. Managers should also engage in cross-functional training to foster understanding of MAS concepts among logistics, IT, and strategy teams, ensuring smooth technology integration and adoption. Finally, the success of MAS depends heavily on inter-organizational collaboration; thus, establishing *shared governance models* and *data-sharing agreements* is essential for realizing the full potential of decentralized, intelligent supply chains [UT 186, UT 308].

Managers seeking to harness multi-agent systems in supply chains should prioritize modular and scalable frameworks that support collaboration without demanding full data transparency, as seen in virtual organizations and decentralized agent infrastructures [UT 245, UT 221]. In logistics operations, MARL-based methods can outperform FIFO or rank-based models, particularly in last-mile and task allocation problems, thus improving service level and operational efficiency [UT 256]. For warehousing and cross-docking, the adoption of multi-agent truck scheduling models that integrate real-world constraints like limited storage can significantly reduce inventory levels and completion times [UT 265]. Practitioners should also consider hybrid models that combine agent-based simulation with domain-specific algorithms to balance cost, environmental goals, and service delivery, particularly in sectors like medical waste or crisis logistics [UT 243, UT 228]. To support deployment, investments in cloud infrastructure that enable distributed optimization and real-time responsiveness are crucial, especially for firms operating across multiple regions or with fluctuating computational needs [UT 245]. Finally, training and development initiatives should focus on building internal capabilities for modeling, interpreting, and managing these agent-based systems to ensure long-term operational integration and strategic agility.

For managers seeking to enhance supply chain resilience and efficiency, the deployment of multi-agent reinforcement learning systems offers transformative potential. Practitioners should consider implementing joint policy learning frameworks that optimize across tasks like packing, storage, and last-mile delivery, thereby reducing costs and improving service levels [UT 390]. In transportation, MARL systems equipped with encoder-decoder structures and route recorders can significantly reduce delivery times and computational burdens, offering a clear advantage over traditional heuristics [UT 291]. Inventory planners are encouraged to adopt collaborative multi-agent VMI models, which have demonstrated effectiveness in minimizing lost sales and improving stock turnover through continuous review policies [UT 294]. The integration of simulation-based optimization tools can assist managers in strategic decisions involving manufacturer selection and lot sizing, especially in virtual supply chain environments [UT 375]. For urban and regional logistics, agent-based simulations can be used to forecast the impacts of green policy interventions, such as zero-emission zones, thus enabling data-driven infrastructure planning [UT 219]. Robotics managers should explore compact, multi-agent delivery systems like LIMMS, which support high-density deployment and hybrid planning across sub-tasks [UT 310]. Importantly, managers should foster a culture that embraces adaptive learning architectures, where heuristic methods are not discarded but rather fused with deep learning models to enhance responsiveness and robustness in uncertain environments [UT 363, UT 290]. This hybrid mindset will be essential for navigating the complexities of modern, AI-driven supply chains.
