AB THE_DRAMATIC_GROWTH of GLOBAL_E_COMMERCE has led to A_SURGE in DEMAND for
   efficient and cost EFFECTIVE_ORDER_FULFILLMENT which can increase customers
   ' SERVICE_LEVELS and sellers ' competitiveness . however ,
   MANAGING_ORDER_FULFILLMENT is challenging due_to A_SERIES of
   INTERDEPENDENT_ONLINE_SEQUENTIAL_DECISION_MAKING_PROBLEMS . to clear
   THIS_HURDLE , rather_than solving THE_PROBLEMS separately as attempted in
   SOME_RECENT_RESEARCHES , this paper proposes A_METHOD based on
   MULTI_AGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING to integratively solve THE_SERIES of
   INTERCONNECTED_PROBLEMS , encompassing ORDER_HANDLING , PACKING and PICKUP ,
   STORAGE , order consolidation , and LAST_MILE_DELIVERY . in_particular , we
   MODEL_THE_INTEGRATED_PROBLEM as A_MARKOV_GAME , wherein A_TEAM of
   AGENTS_LEARNS_A_JOINT_POLICY via interacting with A_SIMULATED_ENVIRONMENT .
   since NO_SIMULATED_ENVIRONMENT supporting
   THE_COMPLETE_ORDER_FULFILLMENT_PROBLEM exists , we devise
   ORDER_FULFILLMENT_COOPERATIVE_MULTI_AGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING
   SCALABLE_ENVIRONMENT ( OFCOURSE ) in THE_OPENAI_GYM_STYLE , which allows
   REPRODUCTION and RE_UTILIZATION to build CUSTOMIZED_APPLICATIONS . by
   constructing THE_FULFILLMENT_SYSTEM in OFCOURSE , we optimize A_JOINT_POLICY
   that solves THE_INTEGRATED_PROBLEM , facilitating
   SEQUENTIAL_ORDER_WISE_OPERATIONS across ALL_FULFILLMENT_UNITS and minimizing
   THE_TOTAL_COST of fulfilling ALL_ORDERS within THE_PROMISED_TIME . with
   OFCOURSE , we also demonstrate that THE_JOINT_POLICY learned by
   MULTI_AGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_OUTPERFORMS_THE_COMBINATION of
   LOCALLY_OPTIMAL_POLICIES . THE_SOURCE_CODE of OFCOURSE is available at :

AB PLANNING_THE_MOST_EFFICIENT_ROUTES in A_COOPERATIVE_MANNER is A_CHALLENGE
   for MANY_MOBILITY_AND_LOGISTICS_SERVICE_PROVIDERS . in this paper ,
   A_NEW_METHODOLOGICAL_APPROACH is presented based on the
   MULTI_AGENT_PATH_PLANNING ( MAPP ) problem which is A_VARIANT of
   THE_CLASSICAL_MULTIPLE_TRAVELING_SALESMEN_PROBLEM ( MTSP ) . given A_TEAM of
   M_AGENTS that must visit N_TARGETS , THE_OPTIMAL_PATHS_PLAN ( A_SET of
   M_PATHS ) should be determined such_that EACH_TARGET is visited only once .
   minimizing THE_TIME of THIS_COOPERATIVE_OPERATION is THE_OPTIMIZATION_GOAL
   in this study . thus , THE_PLAN is optimal , if THE_LONGEST_PATH in THE_PLAN
   is the shortest possible ( MIN_MAX_PROBLEM ) . in_order_to deal with
   MORE_PRACTICAL_SITUATIONS , TWO_ADDITIONAL_CONSTRAINTS are applied :
   THE_MAXIMUM_NUMBER of TARGETS_EACH_AGENT is allowed to visit , and
   THE_MAXIMUM_RANGE for EACH_AGENT . accordingly , a so called
   CONSTRAINED_MULTI_AGENT_PATH_PLANNING ( CMAPP ) problem is elaborated in
   this paper . an easy to apply GENETIC_ALGORITHM ( GA ) is presented , which
   improves THE_PATHS using genetic like OPERATORS and a HEURISTIC_METHOD .
   THE_APPLICABILITY of THE_APPROXIMATE_SOLUTION was tested in
   FOUR_RANDOM_SCENARIOS where it showed A_DECENT_PERFORMANCE .
   THE_DEVELOPED_METHOD can be used for ROUTE_PLANNING of
   MOBILITY_AND_LOGISTICS_SERVICES in which SEVERAL_DESTINATIONS must be
   reached by a FLEET_OF_VEHICLES ( E . g . , GROUP_RIDE_SHARING ,

AB in THE_MODERN_SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM , LARGE_SCALE_TRANSPORTATION_TASKS require
   THE_COLLABORATIVE_WORK of MULTIPLE_VEHICLES to be completed on TIME . over
   THE_PAST_FEW_DECADES , MULTI_VEHICLE_ROUTE_PLANNING was mainly implemented
   by HEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS . however , THESE_ALGORITHMS face THE_DILEMMA of
   LONG_COMPUTATION_TIME . in RECENT_YEARS ,
   SOME_MACHINE_LEARNING_BASED_METHODS are also proposed for
   VEHICLE_ROUTE_PLANNING , but THE_EXISTING_ALGORITHMS can hardly solve
   MULTI_VEHICLE_TIME_SENSITIVE_PROBLEMS . to overcome THIS_PROBLEM , we
   propose A_NOVEL_MULTI_AGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_MODEL , which optimizes
   THE_ROUTE_LENGTH and THE_VEHICLE_ARRIVAL_TIME simultaneously . THE_MODEL is
   based on THE_ENCODER_DECODER_FRAMEWORK . THE_ENCODER mines THE_RELATIONSHIP
   between THE_CUSTOMER_NODES in THE_PROBLEM , and THE_DECODER generates
   THE_ROUTE of EACH_VEHICLE iteratively . specially , we
   DESIGN_MULTIPLE_ROUTE_RECORDERS to extract THE_ROUTE_HISTORY_INFORMATION of
   VEHICLES and realize THE_COMMUNICATION between them . in THE_INFERRING_PHASE
   , THE_MODEL could immediately GENERATE_ROUTES for ALL_VEHICLES in
   A_NEW_INSTANCE . to further improve THE_PERFORMANCE of THE_MODEL , we devise
   A_MULTI_SAMPLING_STRATEGY and obtain THE_BALANCE_BOUNDARY between
   COMPUTATION_TIME and PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT . in_addition , we propose
   A_SIMULATION_BASED_VEHICLE_CONFIGURATION_METHOD to select THE_OPTIMAL_NUMBER
   of VEHICLES in REAL_APPLICATIONS . for VALIDATION , we conduct A_SERIES of

   LIMMS is a symmetrically designed , 6 DEGREE_OF_FREEDOM ( DOF ) appendage
   like ROBOT with WHEELS and LATCHING_MECHANISMS at BOTH_ENDS . by latching
   onto A_SURFACE and anchoring at ONE_END , LIMMS can function as a
