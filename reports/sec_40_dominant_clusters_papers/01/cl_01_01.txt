   A_MULTI_AGENT_METHOD for selecting PRODUCT_SUPPLIERS , which
   AUTOMATES_SUPPLIER_SELECTION and speeds up THE_DECISION_MAKING_PROCESS of
   THE_SELLER . THE_DEVELOPED_METHOD includes determining THE_CHARACTERISTICS
   of PRODUCT_SUPPLIERS , creating A_PROTOCOL for INTERACTION between
   THE_SELLER and SUPPLIERS , DEVELOPING_METHODS for FORMING_REQUIREMENTS for
   SUPPLIERS , analyzing THE_CHARACTERISTICS of SUPPLIERS and evaluating
   SUPPLIERS based on THE_RESULTS of THEIR_WORK .
   THE_PROPOSED_METAHEURISTIC_METHOD for assigning ORDERS to PRODUCT_SUPPLIERS
   is based on A_GENETIC_ALGORITHM and , through THE_USE of DYNAMIC_PARAMETERS
   , improves THE_ACCURACY and SPEED of THE_METHOD and ensures ITS_CONVERGENCE

   THE_TRADITIONAL_TOOL for optimizing SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT ( SCM ) , the

   , as mentioned earlier . furthermore , we aim to compare

AB THE_DISTRIBUTED_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS using CONSENSUS_CONTROL are proposed

   THE_MULTI_AGENT_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEM has

   formulated as A_MIXED_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING_PROBLEM . in this study , we
   propose TWO_DISTRIBUTED_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS to solve THE_PROBLEM .
   A_FEASIBLE_SOLUTION is obtained by solving
   THE_CONTINUOUS_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEM using
   AN_EXISTING_DISTRIBUTED_OPTIMIZATION_METHOD with CONSENSUS_CONTROL and
   solving THE_DISCRETE_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEM by fixing 0 1 variables . in the
   proposed method 1 , ALL_POSSIBLE_COMBINATIONS of A_BINARY_VARIABLES are
   searched . since ALL_COMBINATIONS are searched , THE_EXACT_OPTIMAL_SOLUTION
   can be obtained . however , it is difficult to apply to LARGE_SCALE_PROBLEMS
   . in the proposed method 2 , we derive THE_SOLUTION of BINARY_VARIABLES by
   using LAGRANGIAN_DECOMPOSITION_AND_COORDINATION_APPROACH . the proposed
   method 2 can provide APPROXIMATE_SOLUTIONS for MORE_COMPLEX_PROBLEMS within
   A_PRACTICAL_COMPUTATION_TIME . THESE_METHODS are successfully implemented to
