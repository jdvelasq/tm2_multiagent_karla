AB THIS_ARTICLE demonstrates THE_APPLICATION of

   INDIVIDUAL_SN_ENTITIES . addressing THE_ISSUE of LIMITED_INFORMATION_SHARING
   between SN_ENTITIES . and sustaining COMPETITIVENESS of sns in
   DYNAMIC_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENTS . to_this_end , a multistage , MULTIECHELON_SN
   consisting of GEOGRAPHICALLY_DISPERSED_SN_ENTITIES catering to
   DISTINCT_PRODUCT_MARKET_PROFILES was modeled . in
   MODELING_THE_SNC_DECISION_PROBLEM , TWO_TYPES of AGENTS , each having
   DISTINCT_ATTRIBUTES and FUNCTIONS , were used . THE_MODELING_APPROACH
   incorporated A_REVERSE_AUCTIONING_PROCESS to simulate THE_BEHAVIOR of
   SN_ENTITIES with DIFFERING_INDIVIDUAL_GOALS collectively contributing to
   ENHANCE_SN_LEVEL_PERFORMANCE , by means of setting RESERVE_VALUES generated
   through THE_APPLICATION of A_GENETIC_ALGORITHM . A_SET of
   PARETO_OPTIMAL_SNCS catering to DISTINCT_PRODUCT_MARKET_PROFILES was
   generated using NONDOMINATED_SORTING_GENETIC_ALGORITHM_II .
   FURTHER_EVALUATION of THESE_SNCS against ADDITIONAL_CRITERIA , using
   A_RULE_BASED_APPROACH , allowed THE_SELECTION of THE_MOST_APPROPRIATE_SNC to
   meet A_BROADER_SET of CONDITIONS . THE_MODEL was tested using
   A_REFRIGERATOR_SN_CASE_STUDY drawn from THE_LITERATURE . THE_RESULTS reveal
   that A_NUMBER of SNC_DECISIONS can be supported by THE_PROPOSED_MODEL ,

PY 2022
AB SAME_DAY_DELIVERY ( SDD ) services have become increasingly popular in
   RECENT_YEARS . these have been usually modeled by PREVIOUS_STUDIES as
   A_CERTAIN_CLASS of DYNAMIC_VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM ( DVRP ) where GOODS must
   be delivered from A_DEPOT to a SET_OF_CUSTOMERS in THE_SAME_DAY that
   THE_ORDERS were placed . ADAPTIVE_EXACT_SOLUTION_METHODS for dvrps can
   become intractable even for SMALL_PROBLEM_INSTANCES . in this paper ,
   THE_SAME_DAY_DELIVERY_PROBLEM ( SDDP ) is formulated as
   A_MARKOV_DECISION_PROCESS ( MDP ) and it is solved using
   A_PARAMETER_SHARING_DEEP_Q_NETWORK , which corresponds to a
   DECENTRALISED_MULTI_AGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING ( MARL ) approach . for
   this , A_MULTI_AGENT_GRID_BASED_SDD_ENVIRONMENT is created , consisting of
   MULTIPLE_VEHICLES , a CENTRAL_DEPOT , and DYNAMIC_ORDER_GENERATION .
   in_addition , ZONE_SPECIFIC_ORDER_GENERATION_AND_REWARD_PROBABILITIES are
   introduced . THE_PERFORMANCE of THE_PROPOSED_MARL_APPROACH is compared
   against a MIXED_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING ( MIP ) solution . RESULTS show that
   THE_PROPOSED_MARL_FRAMEWORK performs on PAR with MIP_BASED_POLICY when
   THE_NUMBER of ORDERS is relatively low . for PROBLEM_INSTANCES with
   HIGHER_ORDER_ARRIVAL_RATES , COMPUTATIONAL_RESULTS show that the
   MARL_APPROACH_UNDERPERFORMS_MIP by up to 30 % . THE_PERFORMANCE_GAP between
   BOTH_METHODS becomes smaller when ZONE_SPECIFIC_PARAMETERS are employed .
   THE_GAP is reduced from 30 % to 3 % for a 5 3 5 GRID_SCENARIO with 30 ORDERS
   . EXECUTION_TIME_RESULTS indicate that THE_MARL_APPROACH is , on average ,
   65 times faster than THE_MIP_BASED_POLICY , and therefore may be more
   advantageous for REAL_TIME_CONTROL , at_least for SMALL_SIZED_INSTANCES .
