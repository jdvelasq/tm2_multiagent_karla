   has been focused on as A_MEANS of securing EMPLOYMENT_OPPORTUNITIES in
   THE_FIELD of LAST_MILE_DELIVERY . however , ONLY_A_FEW_STUDIES consider both
   the DRIVER_REFUSAL right and the buffering STRATEGY . this paper aims at
   improving THE_PERFORMANCE involving both of the above . we propose
   A_DRIVER_TASK matching ALGORITHM that complies with
   THE_DELIVERY_TIME_CONSTRAINTS using MULTI_AGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING .

AB A_REVIEW of RECENT_LAST_MILE_DELIVERY_OPTIMIZATION_PROPOSALS is presented .
   THE_PROPOSALS are classified according to THE_CRITERIA of COLLABORATION ,
   ranging from OPTIMIZATION of A_SINGLE_ROUTE to THE_INTEGRATION of
   MULTIPLE_CARRIERS . AN_ALTERNATIVE_PROPOSAL is presented , based also on
   COLLABORATION , but which does not involve EITHER_INTEGRATION into
   A_SINGLE_ORGANIZATION or SHARING of ITS_RESOURCES . EACH_CARRIER is
   represented as A_VIRTUAL_ORGANIZATION of AGENTS ( VO ) . A_GLOBAL_OPTIMIZER
   , ALSO_A_VO , oversees THE_SEARCH for DELIVERIES that can be better
   delivered by ANOTHER_CARRIER and NEW_ROUTES are calculated based on
   A_WIN_WIN_APPROACH . THIS_APPROACH has THE_ADVANTAGES of being easily
   configurable by integrating or removing THE_VO of EACH_CARRIER , highly
   distributable using A_CLOUD_INFRASTRUCTURE , easily scalable both for
   PHYSICAL_AREAS and COMPUTATIONAL_RESOURCES using THE_CLOUD_INFRASTRUCTURE
   in_case more COMPUTATIONAL_POWER is needed . it also allows THE_SHARING of
   THE_LEAST_AMOUNT of INFORMATION possible among CARRIERS , so_that they only

PY 2021
AB ONE_MOST_IMPORTANT_AND_CRITICAL_PROBLEM in A_CROSS_DOCKING_SYSTEM is
   TRUCK_SCHEDULING . MANY_STUDIES in it assumed that THE_TEMPORARY_STORAGE is
   unlimited which is in THE_REAL_WORLD , THE_TEMPORARY_STORAGE is limited .
   many STUDIES_FOCUS on minimizing TOTAL_COMPLETION_TIME . meanwhile , STUDIES
   that focus on minimizing TEMPORARY_STORAGE are hard to find , although
   THIS_ASPECT is very important . due_to ITS_COMPLEXITY , especially in
   THE_CROSS_DOCKING_SYSTEM with MULTIPRODUCT_CHARACTERISTICS ,
   MANUAL_SCHEDULING is almost impossible to achieve ITS_GOALS . MANY_STUDIES
   used SEVERAL_TECHNIQUES , such_as GENETIC_ALGORITHM ( GA ) and
   MIXED_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING where THESE_METHODS are computationally expensive
   . based on THIS_PROBLEM , in this work , we propose
   NEW_TRUCK_SCHEDULING_MODEL in A_CROSS_DOCKING_TERMINAL with
   LIMITED_TEMPORARY_STORAGE_CONSTRAINT . THIS_MODEL is developed by using
   MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM . the main contribution of this work is proposing
   THE_MULTI_AGENT based TRUCK_SCHEDULING_MODEL with LIMITED_TEMPORARY_STORAGE_
   CAPACITY_CONSTRAINT_AND_TEMPORARY_TRUCK_CHANGEOVER_PERMIT . in it , there
   are THREE_AGENTS : INBOUND_TRUCKS_SCHEDULER_AGENT ,
   OUTBOUND_TRUCKS_SCHEDULER_AGENT , and MATERIAL_HANDLER_AGENT .
   THE_SHORTEST_REMAINING_TIME_ALGORITHM is adopted in EVERY_AGENT . based on
   THE_SIMULATION_RESULT , THIS_PROPOSED_MODEL is proven competitive compared
   with THE_EXISTING_FIFO_BASED_MODELS and INTEGER_PROGRAMMING_BASED_MODEL .
   compared with THE_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING_MODEL , it creates 41.8 percent lower
   in MAXIMUM_INVENTORY_LEVEL . compared with THE_FIFO_BASED_MODEL , it creates
   52.1 to 55.1 percent lower in MAXIMUM_INVENTORY_LEVEL . in TOTAL_TIME_ASPECT
   , it creates 0.2 to 2.2 percent lower than THE_FIFO_BASED_MODEL . it creates
   7.2 percent higher in TOTAL_TIME compared with
