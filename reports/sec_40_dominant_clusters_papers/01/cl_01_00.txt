AB in RECENT_YEARS , THE_ADOPTION of TRUCKDRONE_COLLABORATIVE_DELIVERY has

   during THE_LAST_MILE_DELIVERIES by TRUCKS . TRUCKS serve not only as
   A_CARRIER_PLATFORM for DRONES but also as STORAGE_HUBS and ENERGY_SOURCES
   for THESE_UNMANNED_AERIAL_VEHICLES . drawing from THE_DISTINCTIVE_ATTRIBUTES
   of TRUCKDRONE_COLLABORATIVE_DELIVERY , this research has created
   A_MULTI_DRONE_DELIVERY_ENVIRONMENT utilizing THE_MPE_LIBRARY . furthermore ,
   A_SPECTRUM of OPTIMIZATION_TECHNIQUES has been employed to enhance
   THE_ALGORITHM_EFFICACY within THE_TRUCKDRONE_DISTRIBUTION_SYSTEM . finally ,
   A_COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS is conducted with
   OTHER_MULTI_AGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS within

AB given THE_DYNAMIC_NATURE of URBAN_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT_PROCESSES ,
   THE_INVOLVED_TRANSPORT_AND_LOGISTICS_OPERATORS face with
   INTERNAL_AND_EXTERNAL_ISSUES that should tackle to improve LAST_MILE_LEVELS
   of SERVICE and decrease TOTAL_COSTS while performing DELIVERY_OPERATIONS .
   CUSTOMERS ( i . E . , FREIGHT_RECEIVERS ) perceive the LEVEL_OF_SERVICE
   through THE_ACCEPTANCE of THEIR_REQUESTS , while TOTAL_OPERATIONAL_COSTS are
   mainly determined by THE_TOTAL_TRAVEL_COSTS ( i . E . , DISTANCE and or TIME
   ) required to accomplish the CUSTOMERS ' request . in_addition ,
   THE_VEHICLE_KILOMETRES travelled are related to THE_EXTERNALITIES produced .
   given_that THE_ACTORS involved in_the_process operate in
   A_STOCHASTIC_ENVIRONMENT ( with CHANGES that can occur both in_terms_of
   DEMAND_RECEIVERS ' requests , and in SUPPLY_TRAVEL_TIMES ) , COLLABORATION
   and COORDINATION among THE_OPERATORS could play A_KEY_ROLE in meeting the
   CUSTOMERS ' requests as_well_as in reducing
   BOTH_INTERNAL_AND_EXTERNAL_DELIVERY_COSTS . therefore , the paper proposes
   AN_UFT_MODELLING_FRAMEWORK that integrates
   COLLABORATION_AND_COORDINATION_PROCESSES among THE_DIFFERENT_INVOLVED_ACTORS
   , and allows THE_BENEFITS to be assessed . THE_MODEL has
   A_MULTI_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE based on MICROSIMULATION . in_particular ,
   THE_MULTI_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE allows US to_point_out the DIFFERENT_ACTORS '
   responses to various internal ( E . g . , DELIVERY_REQUESTS ) and external (
   E . g . , DELIVERY_TIMES ) CHANGES occurring in
   THE_DAILY_DELIVERY_OPERATIONS . it consists of THREE_LAYERS . THE_FIRST_ONE
   simulates THE_INTERACTIONS among ACTORS operating collaboratively .
   THE_SECOND_LAYER microsimulates THE_COLLABORATIVE_PROCESSES of
   INFORMATION_MANAGEMENT . finally , A_THIRD_LAYER integrates
   THE_TWO_PREVIOUS_LAYERS , facilitating A_DECISION_MAKING_PROCESS in

   A_REAL_CASE_STUDY in which it is possible to VALIDATE_PROS and CONS of
   working in A_COLLABORATIVE_AND_COORDINATIVE_ENVIRONMENT . THE_RESULTS show
   SIGNIFICANT_BENEFITS from ACTORS_OPERATORS involved in_the_process and

   , and PRODUCTION_DIVISIONS is essential for EFFECTIVE_SCHEDULING . for
   MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS in HETEROGENEOUS_SCS , it is crucial to have
   A_PRIOR_UNDERSTANDING of PRODUCTION , DELIVERY , and CONNECTIVITY . hence ,
   AN_INNOVATIVE_META_HEURISTIC_OPTIMIZATION inspired by SPARROW_BEHAVIOR is
   introduced as MULTI_AGENT_BASED_SCHEDULING_AND_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION ( MA_SRA
   ) to resolve DELIVERY_DELAYS and ERRORS during DELIVERY in

   WORKABLE_SCHEDULES in AN_SC with MULTIPLE_AGENTS are
   THE_PRIMARY_SIGNIFICANT_PROBLEMS focused on in this research .
   THE_MA_SRA_ALGORITHM provides AN_ACHIEVABLE_SOLUTION to THE_PROBLEM of
   optimizing LOGISTICS_OPERATIONS by combining PRECISE_SCHEDULING with
   PRODUCTION_BALANCE_AND_MULTI_AGENT_SEARCHERS . if THE_SCHEDULING_OPERATIONS
   are inadequate , SPARSE_AGENTS are repurposed for PRODUCTION based on
