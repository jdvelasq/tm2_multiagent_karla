AB RECENT_GLOBAL_DISRUPTIONS , such_as the COVID_19_PANDEMIC and

   in TRADITIONAL_SUPPLY_CHAINS , requiring EXPLORATION of
   MORE_RESILIENT_ALTERNATIVES . among VARIOUS_SOLUTION_OFFERINGS ,
   AUTONOMOUS_SUPPLY_CHAINS ( ASCS ) have emerged as KEY_ENABLERS of
   INCREASED_INTEGRATION and VISIBILITY , enhancing FLEXIBILITY and RESILIENCE
   in TURBULENT_TRADE_ENVIRONMENTS through THE_WIDESPREAD_AUTOMATION of
   LOW_LEVEL_DECISION_MAKING . although ASC_SOLUTIONS have been discussed and
   trialled over SEVERAL_YEARS , they still lack
   WELL_ESTABLISHED_THEORETICAL_FOUNDATIONS . this paper addresses
   THIS_RESEARCH_GAP by presenting A_FORMAL_DEFINITION of ASC along_with
   ITS_DEFINING_CHARACTERISTICS and AUXILIARY_CONCEPTS . we propose

   AN_ILLUSTRATIVE_CASE_STUDY focusing_on THE_MEAT_SUPPLY_CHAIN demonstrates
