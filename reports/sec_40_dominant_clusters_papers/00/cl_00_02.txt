AB THE_BULLWHIP_EFFECT is one of THE_MOST_IMPORTANT_REASONS for reducing
   THE_PERFORMANCE of THE_SUPPLY_CHAIN ( SC ) and imposes MANY_COSTS on
   THE_INDUSTRY . VARIOUS_REASONS because_the BULLWHIP_EFFECT ( BWE ) , the
   most important of which are IMPROPER_CLASSIFICATION of ORDERS or
   PERIODIC_REVIEWS . THIS_PAPER first proposed THE_STATE_SPACE_MODEL of
   A_SUPPLY_CHAIN with A_PERIODIC_REVIEW_POLICY . we indicated that by
   categorizing and TIMING_ORDERS periodically with THE_CONCEPTS of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT , we reach A_THREE_AGENT_STRUCTURE with A_T_ORDER (
   cycle of ORDERS ) . THE_INTERACTION of THE_AGENTS in THIS_MODEL has
   A_SPANNING_TREE , so it was shown that THE_THREE_AGENT_APPROACH with T_ORDER
   can efficiently send OPTIMAL_PERIODIC_ORDERS to regulate and
   STABILIZE_DEMAND_FLUCTUATIONS . THE_AGENTS moved to
   AN_AGREED_INVENTORY_LEVEL by maintaining A_CERTAIN_DISTANCE from
   THEIR_INVENTORY with OTHER_AGENTS to adjust THE_BWE ( an example of swarming
   in MULTI_AGENT_CONTROL ) . due_to THE_EXISTENCE of STORAGE_COSTS and
   THE_DEMAND_FORECASTING that THE_PRODUCTION_AGENT adopts as THE_LEADER ,
   A_PROHIBITED_LEVEL of INVENTORY , should be taken into ACCOUNT , and AGENTS
   should avoid THESE_LEVELS . THIS_PROBLEM was solved using THE_DISCUSSION of
   avoiding OBSTACLES in MULTI_AGENT_CONTROL . finally , THE_EFFICIENCY of the
   proposed method was probed by simulating and expressing THE_EQUIVALENCE of
   CONCEPTS , such_as POSITION , SPEED , and ACCELERATION with VARIABLES of
   INITIAL_INVENTORY , PRODUCTION , and PRODUCTION_RATE . the author ( s )
