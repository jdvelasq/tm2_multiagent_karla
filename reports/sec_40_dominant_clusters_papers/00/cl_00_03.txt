   THE_CURRENT_SUPPLY_CHAIN_NEW_BUSINESS_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM is not perfect , and

   studied THE_CONSTRUCTION of MULTI_AGENT_TECHNOLOGY in
   THE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_NEW_BUSINESS_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM , aiming to further improve
   THE_MANAGEMENT_ABILITY of THE_SYSTEM through MULTI_AGENT_TECHNOLOGY . this
   article experimentally tested THE_PROFIT_IMPROVEMENT of ENTERPRISES using
   THE_MULTI_AGENT_TECHNOLOGY in
   THE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_NEW_BUSINESS_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM . THE_DATA showed that
   THE_COMPANY_PROFIT increased by at_least 12 % and at most 19 % , indicating
