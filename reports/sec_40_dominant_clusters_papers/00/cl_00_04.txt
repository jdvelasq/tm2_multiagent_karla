   shifted beyond INDIVIDUAL_COMPANIES to THE_ENTIRE_SC_ECOSYSTEM . reducing
   OVERALL_SC_COSTS is crucial for SUCCESS and BENEFITS_ALL_PARTICIPANTS .
   ONE_EFFECTIVE_APPROACH to achieve this is through DIGITAL_TRANSFORMATION ,

   DECISION_POLICIES among ENTITIES . however , THE_RISK of

   ( PMARL ) method to ENHANCE_SC_VISIBILITY , COORDINATION , and PERFORMANCE
   during INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT while effectively mitigating THE_RISK of

   THE_SC_INVENTORY_POLICIES are optimized using
   MULTI_AGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING with

   THE_SIMULATION_BASED_EVALUATION_RESULTS illustrate that THE_PMARL_METHOD

AB THE_LOGISTICS_AND_TRANSPORTATION_SECTORS are struggling to

   concept provides AN_OPPORTUNITY to improve CONTAINER_SHARING and
   TRANSPORTATION by intelligently organising LOGISTICS_RESOURCES . this paper
   shows how PI_PRINCIPLES can address THE_EC_PROBLEM in TRUCK_TRANSPORTATION .
   THE_OBJECTIVE is to reduce co2 emissions with
   IMPROVED_SPACE_SHARING_STRATEGIES . THE_PROBLEM is formulated and solved
   using A_TWO_STAGE_OPTIMISATION_APPROACH ( 2stage opt ) to
   OPTIMISE_CONTAINER_MOTION . THE_VALIDITY of the 2stage opt solutions is
   tested using a developed MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_SIMULATION_MODEL to replicate

   A_REAL_WORLD_CASE_STUDY from A_MULTI_MODAL_LOGISTICS_CENTRE in THE_NORTH of

   using THE_OVERALL_COSTS of THE_SYSTEM as A_MINIMIZATION_TARGET for
   EACH_ACTOR , HAPPO achieves LOWER_OVERALL_COSTS when THE_MINIMIZATION_TARGET
   for EACH_ACTOR is A_COMBINATION of ITS_OWN_COSTS and THE_OVERALL_COSTS of
