AB PLANNING_THE_MOST_EFFICIENT_ROUTES in A_COOPERATIVE_MANNER is A_CHALLENGE
   for MANY_MOBILITY_AND_LOGISTICS_SERVICE_PROVIDERS . in this paper ,
   A_NEW_METHODOLOGICAL_APPROACH is presented based on the
   MULTI_AGENT_PATH_PLANNING ( MAPP ) problem which is A_VARIANT of
   THE_CLASSICAL_MULTIPLE_TRAVELING_SALESMEN_PROBLEM ( MTSP ) . given A_TEAM of
   M_AGENTS that must visit N_TARGETS , THE_OPTIMAL_PATHS_PLAN ( A_SET of
   M_PATHS ) should be determined such_that EACH_TARGET is visited only once .
   minimizing THE_TIME of THIS_COOPERATIVE_OPERATION is THE_OPTIMIZATION_GOAL
   in this study . thus , THE_PLAN is optimal , if THE_LONGEST_PATH in THE_PLAN
   is the shortest possible ( MIN_MAX_PROBLEM ) . in_order_to deal with
   MORE_PRACTICAL_SITUATIONS , TWO_ADDITIONAL_CONSTRAINTS are applied :
   THE_MAXIMUM_NUMBER of TARGETS_EACH_AGENT is allowed to visit , and
   THE_MAXIMUM_RANGE for EACH_AGENT . accordingly , a so called
   CONSTRAINED_MULTI_AGENT_PATH_PLANNING ( CMAPP ) problem is elaborated in
   this paper . an easy to apply GENETIC_ALGORITHM ( GA ) is presented , which
   improves THE_PATHS using genetic like OPERATORS and a HEURISTIC_METHOD .
   THE_APPLICABILITY of THE_APPROXIMATE_SOLUTION was tested in
   FOUR_RANDOM_SCENARIOS where it showed A_DECENT_PERFORMANCE .
   THE_DEVELOPED_METHOD can be used for ROUTE_PLANNING of

AB in THE_MODERN_SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM , LARGE_SCALE_TRANSPORTATION_TASKS require
   THE_COLLABORATIVE_WORK of MULTIPLE_VEHICLES to be completed on TIME . over
   THE_PAST_FEW_DECADES , MULTI_VEHICLE_ROUTE_PLANNING was mainly implemented
   by HEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS . however , THESE_ALGORITHMS face THE_DILEMMA of
   LONG_COMPUTATION_TIME . in RECENT_YEARS ,
   SOME_MACHINE_LEARNING_BASED_METHODS are also proposed for
   VEHICLE_ROUTE_PLANNING , but THE_EXISTING_ALGORITHMS can hardly solve
   MULTI_VEHICLE_TIME_SENSITIVE_PROBLEMS . to overcome THIS_PROBLEM , we
   propose A_NOVEL_MULTI_AGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_MODEL , which optimizes
   THE_ROUTE_LENGTH and THE_VEHICLE_ARRIVAL_TIME simultaneously . THE_MODEL is
   based on THE_ENCODER_DECODER_FRAMEWORK . THE_ENCODER mines THE_RELATIONSHIP
   between THE_CUSTOMER_NODES in THE_PROBLEM , and THE_DECODER generates
   THE_ROUTE of EACH_VEHICLE iteratively . specially , we
   DESIGN_MULTIPLE_ROUTE_RECORDERS to extract THE_ROUTE_HISTORY_INFORMATION of
   VEHICLES and realize THE_COMMUNICATION between them . in THE_INFERRING_PHASE
   , THE_MODEL could immediately GENERATE_ROUTES for ALL_VEHICLES in
   A_NEW_INSTANCE . to further improve THE_PERFORMANCE of THE_MODEL , we devise
   A_MULTI_SAMPLING_STRATEGY and obtain THE_BALANCE_BOUNDARY between
   COMPUTATION_TIME and PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT . in_addition , we propose
   A_SIMULATION_BASED_VEHICLE_CONFIGURATION_METHOD to select THE_OPTIMAL_NUMBER
   of VEHICLES in REAL_APPLICATIONS . for VALIDATION , we conduct A_SERIES of
   EXPERIMENTS on PROBLEMS with DIFFERENT_CUSTOMER_AMOUNTS and
