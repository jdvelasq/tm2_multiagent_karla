AB the covid 19 VACCINATION_MANAGEMENT in JAPAN has revealed MANY_PROBLEMS .
   THE_NUMBER of VACCINES available was clearly less than THE_NUMBER of PEOPLE
   who wanted to be vaccinated . initially , THE_SYSTEM was managed by making
   RESERVATIONS with AGE_GROUP utilizing VACCINATION_COUPONS . after
   THE_SECOND_ROUND of VACCINATIONS , ONLY_APPOINTMENTS for VACCINATION_DATES
   were coordinated and VACCINATION_SITES were set up in SHIBUYA_WARD where
   THE_VACCINE could be taken freely . under A_SHORTAGE of VACCINE_SUPPLY ,
   THE_INABILITY to make APPOINTMENTS arose from A_FAILURE to properly
   ESTIMATE_DEMAND . in_addition , THE_VACCINE expired due_to
   INADEQUATE_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT , resulting_in THE_VACCINE being discarded .
   this is considered to be A_SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROBLEM in which APPROPRIATE_SUPPLY
   could not be provided in response to DEMAND . in response to THIS_PROBLEM ,
   this paper examines whether it is possible to avoid SHORTAGE and
   STOCK_DISCARDS by A_DECENTRALIZED_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM for easy on
   SITE_INVENTORY_CONTROL instead_of A_CENTRALIZED_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM in
   REAL_WORLD . based on A_MULTI_AGENT_MODEL , A_MODEL was created to
   REDISTRIBUTE_INVENTORY to CLIENTS by predicting FUTURE_SHORTAGE based on
   DEMAND_FLUCTUATIONS and PAST_INVENTORY_LEVELS . THE_MODEL was constructed by
   adopting THE_KANTO_REGION . THE_VALIDATION_RESULTS of THE_MODEL showed that
   THE_NUMBER of DISCARDS was reduced by about 70 % and OUT_OF_STOCKS by about

AB INTERNET_FACILITIES helped RETAILERS to sell through ONLINE_CHANNELS , and

   RETAILERS . but , THE_E_COMMERCE_INDUSTRY always confronted THE_ISSUE of

   SCANT_LITERATURE that studies THE_IMPACT of DELIVERY_LEAD_TIME on
   A_DUAL_CHANNEL_SUPPLY_CHAIN consisting of RETAILER and E_TAILER . this
   research paper uses GAME_THEORY to verify THE_IMPACT of DELIVERY_LEAD_TIME
   on PRICING_DECISIONS of A_HETEROGENEOUS_DUAL_CHANNEL_SUPPLY_CHAIN consisting
   of THE_MANUFACTURER , RETAILER , and E_TAILER . we used THE_STACKELBERG_GAME
   to study THE_MANUFACTURER s and downstream partners ' interaction :
   RETAILERS and E_TAILERS . A_HORIZONTAL_NASH_GAME was used to
   MODEL_THE_INTERACTION between THE_DOWNSTREAM_PARTNERS . we had analytically
   modeled how THE_LEAD_DELIVERY_TIME significantly affects
   THE_CHANNEL_PARTNER_OPTIMAL_PRICING , SALES_VOLUME , and PROFITABILITY . we
   also did SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS to check THE_INFLUENCE of the customers '
   CHANNEL_PREFERENCE_COEFFICIENT toward A_PARTICULAR_CHANNEL and
   ITS_CROSS_EFFECTS on THE_PRICING_POLICIES when THE_CUSTOMER is also
   LEAD_TIME sensitive . the study revealed that irrespective of
   LARGE_DELIVERY_TIME or next DAY_DELIVERY_TIME , customers ' preference
   toward A_PARTICULAR_CHANNEL did not affect THE_MANUFACTURER_PROFIT , whereas
   it affected THE_PROFIT of THE_RETAILER and E_TAILER . on_the_other_hand ,
   THE_INCREASE in LEAD_TIME_SENSITIVITY_COEFFICIENT severely affected
   THE_PROFIT of ALL_THE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_PARTNERS . by analyzing
   THE_PRICING_DECISIONS , we found that BOTH_THE_CUSTOMER_PREFERENCE and
   LEAD_TIME_SENSITIVITY_COEFFICIENTS affected THE_PRICING_DECISIONS , but
   customers ' CHANNEL_PREFERENCE_COEFFICIENT failed to mitigate THE_EFFECT of
   LEAD_DELIVERY_TIME . THE_INPUTS from this study can be used by practicing

AB the paper proposes A_METHOD for creating A_COMPUTER_AGENT for SUPPLY_CHAINS
   . THE_NOVELTY of THE_RESEARCH lies in THE_FACT that to increase
   THE_EFFICIENCY of THE_COMPUTER_AGENT , ITS_FUNCTIONING is based on
   THE_CONNECTIONIST_APPROACH instead_of using THE_CLASSICAL_PRODUCTION and
   LOGICAL_APPROACH . to expand THE_RANGE of TASKS solved by AGENTS , the
   article proposes A_REACTIVE_AGENT with FEEDBACK , which makes A_DECISION
   based on PERCEPTION or A_SEQUENCE of PERCEPTIONS and A_PREVIOUS_ACTION or
   A_SEQUENCE of PREVIOUS_ACTIONS , as_well_as A_REACTIVE_AGENT with
   AN_INTERNAL_STATE and FEEDBACK , which is AN_EXTENSION of THE_REACTIVE_AGENT
   with AN_INTERNAL_STATE and makes A_DECISION based on PERCEPTION ,
   PREVIOUS_INTERNAL_STATE , and PREVIOUS_ACTION . for A_REACTIVE_AGENT with
   AN_INTERNAL_STATE and FEEDBACK , A_JORDAN_ELMAN_ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK
   was proposed , which is A_COMBINATION of JORDAN and ELMAN_NEURAL_NETWORKS ,
   and THE_STRUCTURE of ITS_MODEL was determined in THE_COURSE of
   A_NUMERICAL_STUDY . THE_EXPERIMENTS performed showed that when the
   NUMBER_OF_HIDDEN_NEURONS is not less than THE_NUMBER of NEURONS in
   THE_INPUT_LAYER , THE_VALUE of THE_ROOT_MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR does not change
   significantly , and THE_SELECTED_NETWORK gives RESULTS with A_MINIMUM_ERROR
   . METHODS for determining THE_PARAMETERS of
   THE_PROPOSED_JORDAN_ELMAN_NEURAL_NETWORK_MODEL were proposed . this made it
   possible to ENSURE_HIGH_SPEED and ACCURACY of CALCULATIONS based on
   THE_MODEL . the proposed method for creating AN_AGENT based on
   ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS can be used in
   VARIOUS_INTELLIGENT_COMPUTER_SYSTEMS that use MULTI_AGENT_INTERACTION . 2023
