AB THE_PARTNERSHIP_SUPPLY of MARKET_NEEDS is one of
   THE_MOST_REGARDED_ORIENTATIONS in RECENT_YEARS . in this paper ,
   A_COMPETITIVE_MODEL is designed in PARTNERSHIP_SUPPLY_NETWORKS including
   PARENT_FIRMS ( BRANDS ) , MANUFACTURING_PLANTS ,
   GOVERNMENTAL_LOGISTICS_COMPANY and FRANCHISED_STORES . in THE_RAISED_SCHEME
   , THE_INVOLVED_SUPPLY_NETWORKS seek to develop
   THEIR_UPSTREAM_AND_DOWNSTREAM_PARTNERSHIPS ( respectively with
   MANUFACTURING_PLANTS and FRANCHISED_STORES ) in A_COMPETITIVE_ENVIRONMENT .
   besides_this CROSS_NETWORK_COMPETITION , THE_DOWNSTREAM_PARTNERS of
   EACH_NETWORK develop SOME_VIRTUAL_ALLIANCES . in SUCH_ALLIANCES , each of
   THE_INVOLVED_MEMBERS , further pursuing ITS_OWN_INTERESTS , aims to increase
   THE_OVERALL_SHARE of THE_PARENT_BRAND . even more striking ,
   A_MULTI_AGENT_TRANSPORTATION_PLATFORM is implemented in THE_DISTRIBUTION of
   PRODUCTS to meet THE_ENVIRONMENTAL_SUSTAINABILITY_REQUIREMENTS .
   THE_STATE_OWNED_LOGISTICS_COMPANY , as THE_MARKET_LEADER of
   THE_CITED_DISTRIBUTED_STRUCTURE , dictates ITS_STRATEGY to
   THE_SUPPLY_NETWORKS seeking to gain
   THE_MOST_POSSIBLE_PARTNERSHIP_INTERACTIONS . hence , in this paper ,
   A_MULTI_LEVEL_COMPETITION_ORIENTED_PROBLEM is considered in
   THE_PARTNERSHIP_SUPPLY_NETWORKS and formulated upon
   MULTIPLE_HIERARCHICAL_STAGES . due_to THE_NP_HARDNESS of THE_PROBLEM and
   given ITS_STRUCTURAL_FEATURES , A_MATHEURISTIC_APPROACH based on
   A_COMBINATION of THE_BENDERS_DECOMPOSITION_METHOD and

   incorporated A_REVERSE_AUCTIONING_PROCESS to simulate THE_BEHAVIOR of
