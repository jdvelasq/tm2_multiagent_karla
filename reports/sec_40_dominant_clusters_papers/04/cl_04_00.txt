AB given THE_DYNAMIC_NATURE of URBAN_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT_PROCESSES ,
   THE_INVOLVED_TRANSPORT_AND_LOGISTICS_OPERATORS face with
   INTERNAL_AND_EXTERNAL_ISSUES that should tackle to improve LAST_MILE_LEVELS
   of SERVICE and decrease TOTAL_COSTS while performing DELIVERY_OPERATIONS .
   CUSTOMERS ( i . E . , FREIGHT_RECEIVERS ) perceive the LEVEL_OF_SERVICE
   through THE_ACCEPTANCE of THEIR_REQUESTS , while TOTAL_OPERATIONAL_COSTS are
   mainly determined by THE_TOTAL_TRAVEL_COSTS ( i . E . , DISTANCE and or TIME
   ) required to accomplish the CUSTOMERS ' request . in_addition ,
   THE_VEHICLE_KILOMETRES travelled are related to THE_EXTERNALITIES produced .
   given_that THE_ACTORS involved in_the_process operate in
   A_STOCHASTIC_ENVIRONMENT ( with CHANGES that can occur both in_terms_of
   DEMAND_RECEIVERS ' requests , and in SUPPLY_TRAVEL_TIMES ) , COLLABORATION
   and COORDINATION among THE_OPERATORS could play A_KEY_ROLE in meeting the
   CUSTOMERS ' requests as_well_as in reducing
