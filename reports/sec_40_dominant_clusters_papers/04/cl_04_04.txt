AB in HUMANKIND_HISTORY , many NATURAL_AND_MAN_MADE_DISASTERS have happened and
   will continue to happen . in A_POST_DISASTER_SCENARIO , MANY_PROCESSES and
   ACTORS must be organized to provide THE_NEEDED_SUPPLIES to
   THE_AFFECTED_PEOPLE . although it is similar to A_SUPPLY_CHAIN , it is
   called HUMANITARIAN_LOGISTICS in A_DISASTER_CONTEXT . MANY_PAPERS present
   CENTRALIZED_APPROACHES to organizing DIFFERENT_ASPECTS of
   HUMANITARIAN_LOGISTICS . however , A_CENTRALIZED_APPROACH is not always
   appropriate due_to THE_DYNAMICS and UNCERTAINTY present in
   A_POST_DISASTER_SCENARIO . this paper describes A_DISTRIBUTED_APPROACH based
   on MULTIAGENT_SYSTEMS ( MAS ) to organize THE_ELEMENTS of
   HUMANITARIAN_LOGISTICS in A_POST_DISASTER_SCENARIO ( MAS_HL ) .
   INTELLIGENT_AGENTS in THE_MAS_HL , represent REAL_WORLD_ELEMENTS , such_as
   AFFECTED_ZONES , DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS , DONORS , and TRUCKS . THE_AGENTS
   negotiate among themselves using A_CONTRACT_NET_PROTOCOL ( CNP ) to organize
   THE_OPERATIONS of THE_ELEMENTS represented . due_to DYNAMICS and UNCERTAINTY
   in A_POST_DISASTER_SCENARIO , THE_AGENTS must reorganize THE_OPERATIONS of
   THE_ELEMENTS . THE_MAS_HL is evaluated by simulating and evaluating
   A_CASE_STUDY focused on BOTTLED_WATER_DELIVERY in POST_DISASTER_SCENARIOS ,
   they represent when MAJOR_CHANGES occur . THE_COMPUTATIONAL_RESULTS
   confirmed that THE_MAS_HL quickly GENERATES_PLANS to organize THE_ELEMENTS
   of HUMANITARIAN_LOGISTICS and reorganize THE_PLANS when THE_ENVIRONMENT
   changes . 2023 , universidad de tarapaca . all rights reserved .

AB EMERGENCE of RESPONSIBLE_BEHAVIOR is explored in NON_COOPERATIVE_GAMES
   involving AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS . rather_than imposing CONSTRAINTS or
   EXTERNAL_REINFORCEMENTS , AGENTS are endowed with an elastic SENSE_OF_SELF
   or AN_ELASTIC_IDENTITY that they curate based on RATIONAL_CONSIDERATIONS .
   THIS_APPROACH is called COMPUTATIONAL_TRANSCENDENCE ( CT ) . we show that
   AGENTS using THIS_MODEL make CHOICES for COLLECTIVE_WELFARE instead_of
   INDIVIDUAL_BENEFIT . first , RELEVANCE of THIS_MODEL in
   GAME_THEORETIC_CONTEXTS like prisoners ' dilemma and COLLUSION is presented
   . next , A_GENERIC_MULTI_AGENT_FRAMEWORK for simulating DILEMMAS around
   RESPONSIBLE_AGENCY is also proposed . CT implemented on THIS_FRAMEWORK , is
   shown to be versatile in acting responsibly to DIFFERENT_KINDS of
   circumstancesincluding modifying THEIR_STRATEGY based on THEIR_INTERACTION
   with OTHER_AGENTS in THE_SYSTEM as_well_as interacting with ADVERSARIES that
   are RATIONAL_MAXIMIZERS , and who have A_RATIONALE to exploit
   RESPONSIBLE_BEHAVIOR from OTHER_AGENTS . CT is also shown to
   OUTPERFORM_RECIPROCITY as A_STRATEGY for RESPONSIBLE_AUTONOMY . thus , we
   PRESENT_CT as A_FRAMEWORK for building AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS which can
   intrinsically act responsibly in MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS . THE_CORE_MODEL for
   COMPUTATIONAL_ETHICS presented in this paper can potentially be adapted to
   THE_NEEDS of APPLICATIONS in AREAS like SUPPLY_CHAINS , TRAFFIC_MANAGEMENT ,
   and AUTONOMOUS_VEHICLES . THIS_PAPER hopes to motivate FURTHER_RESEARCH on
