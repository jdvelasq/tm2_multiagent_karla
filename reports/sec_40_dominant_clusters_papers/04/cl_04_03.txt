AB FOOD_WASTE is AN_ALARMING_ISSUE pertaining to THE_RISING_GLOBAL_HUNGER ,
   HUGE_ENVIRONMENTAL_FOOTPRINT , and HIGH_MONETARY_VALUE . in
   DEVELOPING_AND_DEVELOPED_NATIONS , it occurs primarily due_to
   INEFFICIENCIES_UPSTREAM and downstream of THE_SUPPLY_CHAIN respectively .
   A_COMMON_FACTOR in BOTH_DEVELOPED_AND_DEVELOPING_NATIONS is PRODUCT_FLOW
   within THE_SUPPLY_CHAIN from FARMS to RETAILERS . this study aims to
   identify THE_ROOT_CAUSES of WASTE generated across THE_PRODUCT_FLOW of
   THE_BEEF_SUPPLY_CHAIN from FARM to RETAILER . A_WORKSHOP involving
   TWENTY_PRACTITIONERS of THE_BEEF_INDUSTRY was conducted and
   THE_COLLECTED_INFORMATION was transcribed and coded to generate
   A_CURRENT_REALITY_TREE , which assisted in identifying ROOT_CAUSES of WASTE
   in THE_ENTIRE_BEEF_SUPPLY_CHAIN . A_MULTI_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_FRAMEWORK
   spanning THE_ENTIRE_BEEF_SUPPLY_CHAIN from FARM to RETAILER is proposed ,
   which is composed of AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS capable of bringing ALL_SEGMENTS of
   THE_BEEF_INDUSTRY on A_SINGLE_PLATFORM and collaboratively assist them in
   mitigating ROOT_CAUSES of WASTE . THE_PROPOSED_FRAMEWORK will aid
   THE_PRACTITIONERS in THE_BEEF_INDUSTRY to reduce WASTE , improve

AB THE_DRAMATIC_GROWTH of GLOBAL_E_COMMERCE has led to A_SURGE in DEMAND for
   efficient and cost EFFECTIVE_ORDER_FULFILLMENT which can increase customers
   ' SERVICE_LEVELS and sellers ' competitiveness . however ,
   MANAGING_ORDER_FULFILLMENT is challenging due_to A_SERIES of
   INTERDEPENDENT_ONLINE_SEQUENTIAL_DECISION_MAKING_PROBLEMS . to clear
   THIS_HURDLE , rather_than solving THE_PROBLEMS separately as attempted in
   SOME_RECENT_RESEARCHES , this paper proposes A_METHOD based on
   MULTI_AGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING to integratively solve THE_SERIES of
   INTERCONNECTED_PROBLEMS , encompassing ORDER_HANDLING , PACKING and PICKUP ,
   STORAGE , order consolidation , and LAST_MILE_DELIVERY . in_particular , we
   MODEL_THE_INTEGRATED_PROBLEM as A_MARKOV_GAME , wherein A_TEAM of
   AGENTS_LEARNS_A_JOINT_POLICY via interacting with A_SIMULATED_ENVIRONMENT .
   since NO_SIMULATED_ENVIRONMENT supporting
   THE_COMPLETE_ORDER_FULFILLMENT_PROBLEM exists , we devise
   ORDER_FULFILLMENT_COOPERATIVE_MULTI_AGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING
   SCALABLE_ENVIRONMENT ( OFCOURSE ) in THE_OPENAI_GYM_STYLE , which allows
   REPRODUCTION and RE_UTILIZATION to build CUSTOMIZED_APPLICATIONS . by
   constructing THE_FULFILLMENT_SYSTEM in OFCOURSE , we optimize A_JOINT_POLICY
   that solves THE_INTEGRATED_PROBLEM , facilitating
   SEQUENTIAL_ORDER_WISE_OPERATIONS across ALL_FULFILLMENT_UNITS and minimizing
   THE_TOTAL_COST of fulfilling ALL_ORDERS within THE_PROMISED_TIME . with
   OFCOURSE , we also demonstrate that THE_JOINT_POLICY learned by

   with COSTEFFECTIVE_INFORMATION , particularly regarding VACCINATION .
   THE_CONTRIBUTION of THIS_ARTICLE is threefold : ( i ) conducting
   A_SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW of most of THE_PRIVACYPRESERVING_APPS and
   THEIR_PROTOCOLS created during PANDEMICS , and we found that MOST_APPS pose
   SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY_VIOLATIONS . ( ii ) proposing AN_AGENT based ,

   A_PRACTICAL_SOLUTION and better than THE_PROPOSED_ACTIVE_DATA_BUNDLES using
