AB INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGY ( ICT ) and ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE
   ( AI ) can support THE_TRANSITION from TRADITIONAL_PRACTICES toward
   SMART_SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION_SCHEMES . SUCH_A_DIRECTION allows for
   integrating ORGANIZATIONAL_LEVELS of NATURAL_GAS_TRANSPORTATION_ENTERPRISES
   , comprising LOCATION_INVENTORY_AND_ROUTING_PROBLEM ( LIRP ) decisions .
   SPECIFIC_WORKS have investigated THE_LIRP of NATURAL_GAS to
   PRODUCT_AND_ENERGY_NETWORKS . however , due_to THE_ABSENCE of
   A_SYSTEMATIC_ICT_ASSISTED_MINDSET , NO_STUDY has been oriented
   from_the_perspective_of THE_DYNAMIC_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT and GEOGRAPHIC_DATA
   driven FEATURES of LAND_RESOURCES . to handle THESE_CHALLENGES , this study
   introduces A_VERTICALLY_COORDINATED_HEURISTIC_OPTIMIZATION_FRAMEWORK , in
   THE_FORM of AN_AUTONOMOUS_MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM , for THE_LIRP of
   GAS_TRANSMISSION_INFRASTRUCTURES as MAJOR_CARRIER_SYSTEMS to
   SUPPLY_FEEDSTOCK_AND_ENERGY_DEMANDS . VARIOUS_EXTENDABLE_BEHAVIOR_CLASSES
   are programmed into THE_FRAMEWORK to support AUTOMATED_AGENT_SPECIALIZATIONS
   regarding PROCEDURAL_TASKS of PLANNING , TRANSIENT_INVENTORY_COORDINATION ,
   ROUTING , and SPATIAL_DATA_MANAGEMENT in THE_SPECIFIC_LIRP_SETTINGS .
   moreover , the study develops AN_ONTOLOGY_DRIVEN_KNOWLEDGE_SYSTEM , formally
   conceptualizing THE_INTENDED_APPLICATION_LEVEL_KNOWLEDGE according to
   A_GENERAL_DOMAIN_SEMANTIC_MODEL . leveraging THE_KNOWLEDGE_SYSTEM ,
   THE_AGENTS determine THE_NECESSARY_STEPS and SUITABLE_READY_MADE_TOOLS to
   solve THE_PROBLEM collaboratively . SEVERAL_INDUSTRIAL_APPLICATIONS showcase
   THE_CAPABILITIES of THE_PROPOSED_FRAMEWORK . THE_RESULTS manifest that
   THE_DEVISED_ONTOLOGY_AUTOMATES_MODEL_CONSTRUCTION and
   THE_ENTIRE_SOLUTION_PROCESS while supporting AGENT_INTEROPERATION and
   scaling THE_PLATFORM_APPLICATIONS to EMERGENT_DOMAINS . additionally ,
   TRANSIENT_DEMAND_FLUCTUATIONS , DYNAMIC_INVENTORY_LEVELS , and
   TOPOLOGICAL_CONSIDERATIONS heavily influence LONG_TERM_PLANNING . compared
   to EXISTING_PRACTICES , THE_ONTOLOGY_DRIVEN_MULTI_AGENT_FRAMEWORK expounds
   A_MORE_REALISTIC_VIEW of THE_TRADE off between STRATEGIC_INVESTMENTS and
   DYNAMIC_OPERATIONAL_WELFARE in THE_GAS_SYSTEM .
