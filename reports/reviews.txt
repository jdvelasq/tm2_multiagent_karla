Title: MACHINE_LEARNING and MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS in oil and
GAS_INDUSTRY_APPLICATIONS: a SURVEY
Abstract:
```
the oil and GAS_INDUSTRY (ogi) has always been associated with challenges
and complexities. it involves many processes and STAKEHOLDERS, each
generating a HUGE_AMOUNT of data. due to the global and distributed
nature of the business, PROCESSING and managing this information is an
ARDUOUS_TASK. many issues such as orchestrating DIFFERENT_DATA_SOURCES,
owners and formats; verifying, validating and securing DATA_STREAMS as
they move along the COMPLEX_BUSINESS_PROCESS_PIPELINE; and getting
insights from data for improving BUSINESS_EFFICIENCY,
SCHEDULING_MAINTENANCE and preventing theft and fraud are to be
addressed. ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai), and MACHINE_LEARNING (ml) in
particular, have gained HUGE_ACCEPTANCE in many areas recently, including
the ogi, to help HUMANS_TACKLE SUCH_COMPLEX_TASKS. furthermore,
multi_agent systems (MAS) as a sub_field of distributed AI_MEET the
requirement of DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEMS and have been utilised successfully in
a VAST_VARIETY of disciplines. several studies have explored the use of
ml and MAS to increase OPERATIONAL_EFFICIENCY, manage SUPPLY_CHAIN and
solve various production_ and maintenance_related tasks in the ogi.
however, ml has only been applied to isolated tasks, and while MAS have
yielded GOOD_PERFORMANCE in simulated environments, they have not gained
the expected popularity among oil and GAS_COMPANIES yet. further RESEARCH
in the fields is necessary to realise the potential of ml and MAS and
encourage their wider acceptance in the ogi. in particular, embedding ml
into MAS can bring many benefits for the FUTURE_DEVELOPMENT of the
INDUSTRY. this PAPER_AIMS to summarise the efforts to date of applying ml
and MAS to OGI_TASKS, identify POSSIBLE_REASONS for their low and
SLOW_UPTAKE and suggest ways to ensure a greater adoption of these
technologies in the ogi.  2019 ELSEVIER_INC.

Title: MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS and COMPLEX_NETWORKS: REVIEW and APPLICATIONS in
SYSTEMS_ENGINEERING
Abstract:
```
SYSTEMS_ENGINEERING is an UBIQUITOUS_DISCIPLINE of engineering
overlapping industrial, chemical, mechanical, MANUFACTURING, CONTROL,
software, electrical, and CIVIL_ENGINEERING. it provides TOOLS for
dealing with the COMPLEXITY and DYNAMICS related to the OPTIMISATION of
physical, natural, and VIRTUAL_SYSTEMS_MANAGEMENT. this paper presents a
REVIEW of how multi_agent systems and COMPLEX_NETWORKS_THEORY are brought
together to ADDRESS_SYSTEMS_ENGINEERING and MANAGEMENT_PROBLEMS. the
REVIEW also encompasses CURRENT and FUTURE_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS both for
THEORETICAL_FUNDAMENTALS and APPLICATIONS in the INDUSTRY. this is made
by considering trends such as mesoscale, multiscale, and
MULTILAYER_NETWORKS along with the state_of_art analysis on
NETWORK_DYNAMICS and INTELLIGENT_NETWORKS. critical and
SMART_INFRASTRUCTURE, MANUFACTURING_PROCESSES, and SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS
are instances of RESEARCH_TOPICS for which this LITERATURE_REVIEW is
highly relevant.  2020 by the authors.

in this paper, we REVIEW_RELEVANT_LITERATURE on the DEVELOPMENT of
multi_agent systems APPLICATIONS for SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. we give a
GENERAL_PICTURE of the STATE_OF_THE_ART, showing the MAIN_APPLICATIONS
developed using this NOVEL_METHODOLOGY for analyzing DIVERSE_PROBLEMS in
INDUSTRY. we also ANALYZE_GENERIC_FRAMEWORKS for SUPPLY_CHAIN MODELLING,
showing their MAIN_CHARACTERISTICS. we discuss the MAIN_TOPICS addressed
with this TECHNIQUE and the degree of DEVELOPMENT of the contributions.

Title: EVALUATION of URBAN_DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS using MULTIAGENT_MODELING with
GEOGRAPHIC_INFORMATION_SYSTEMS
Abstract:
```
CURRENT_BARRIERS to maintaining economies of scale for delivery include
far distances of the depots from CUSTOMERS, ROAD_USAGE_RESTRICTIONS,
CUSTOMERS' DELIVERY_REQUESTS, and social, environmental, and
ECONOMIC_COSTS. in many developed and DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES, the effects
of urbanization have increased CITY_POPULATION. SUCH_MIGRATION to cities
is also attracting more movement of commodities into the CITY_CENTER.
this RESEARCH aimed to study the effectiveness and VIABILITY of
URBAN_DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS from a TACTICAL_VIEWPOINT of PLANNING for
CITY_LOGISTICS. a MULTIAGENT_MODELING approach with
GEOGRAPHICAL_INFORMATION_SYSTEM_SUPPORT was used to test an
URBAN_DISTRIBUTION_CENTER (udc) in OSAKA_CITY, JAPAN. the KEY_FINDINGS
from this RESEARCH concluded that the udc has potential for
EMISSIONS_REDUCTION, but SUSTAINABILITY of the udc is reliant on the
UDC_CHARGES and carriers' sensitivity to the rate of charges.

Title: a FRACTAL_PERSPECTIVE based METHODOLOGICAL_FRAMEWORK for SUPPLY_CHAIN
MODELLING and DISTRIBUTED_SIMULATION with MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM
Abstract:
```
with the DEVELOPMENT of GLOBAL_ECONOMY, SUPPLY_CHAIN, as a recognised
COMPLEX_SYSTEM, is becoming more complex for analysis. in this context,
it is worth introducing the perspective of COMPLEX_SYSTEM in perceiving
and MODELLING of SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM to address ITS dynamic, stochastic
and UNCERTAIN_CHARACTERISTICS. therefore, this paper proposes a
METHODOLOGICAL_FRAMEWORK of SUPPLY_CHAIN MODELLING_AND_SIMULATION based
on the FRACTAL_PERSPECTIVE, and presents an all_round and
SYSTEMATIC_EXPOSITION of concept MODELLING and DISTRIBUTED_SIMULATION by
means of multi_agent TECHNOLOGY. in this framework, different
SUPPLY_CHAIN scenarios focusing on MANUFACTURING, INVENTORY and
TRANSPORTATION can be easily modelled and simulated at DIFFERENT_SCALES
and levels. in addition, a PROTOTYPE_SYSTEM which implements the
METHODOLOGICAL_FRAMEWORK and the KEY_IMPLEMENTATION_TECHNIQUES are
presented as well. finally, a SUPPLY_CHAIN_EXAMPLE, which
SUPPOSES_MANUFACTURER as the CORE_MEMBER, is modelled and simulated with
the PROTOTYPE_SYSTEM to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework.  2014 taylor and francis.
