AB against THE_BACKDROP of GLOBALIZATION , THE_COMPLEXITY of SUPPLY_CHAINS has
   been increasing , making SUPPLY_CHAIN_RESILIENCE_A_CRITICAL_FACTOR in
   ensuring THE_STABLE_OPERATION of ENTERPRISES , NATIONAL_ECONOMIES , and
   INTERNATIONAL_TRADE . THIS_PAPER adopts A_NETWORK_MODELING_PERSPECTIVE to
   systematically review THE_THEORETICAL_FOUNDATIONS and RESEARCH_PROGRESS in
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_RESILIENCE , focusing_on THE_APPLICATION of
   NETWORK_MODELING_METHODS . first , THE_CONCEPT of SUPPLY_CHAIN_RESILIENCE is
   defined , and ITS_DEVELOPMENTAL_TRAJECTORY is reviewed . through
   LITERATURE_VISUALIZATION_ANALYSIS , this study delves into the
   CURRENT_STATE_OF_RESEARCH on SUPPLY_CHAIN_RESILIENCE , addressing CHALLENGES
   and RISK_MANAGEMENT , highlighting THE_IMPORTANCE of
   NETWORK_MODELING_TECHNIQUES in THIS_FIELD . subsequently , it explores
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK_MODELING based on COMPLEX_NETWORKS and
   AGENT_BASED_MODELING , analyzing THEIR_STRENGTHS and LIMITATIONS in
   simulating THE_OVERALL_EVOLUTION of SUPPLY_CHAINS and THE_DYNAMIC_BEHAVIOR
   of INDIVIDUAL_ENTITIES . by integrating NETWORK_STRUCTURAL_CHARACTERISTICS
   with RESILIENCE_EVALUATION_METHODS , this paper suggests
   POTENTIAL_DIRECTIONS for FUTURE_RESEARCH . these include enhancing
   THE_DESCRIPTION of INDIVIDUAL_FIRM_BEHAVIOR , analyzing THE_DYNAMICS of
   INFORMATION_NETWORKS , and emphasizing TASK_ORIENTED_MODEL_DESIGN , thereby
   offering NEW_PERSPECTIVES and PATHWAYS for managing SUPPLY_CHAIN_RESILIENCE
   in A_WAY that can generate SIGNIFICANT_POSITIVE_EXTERNALITIES for
   GLOBAL_ECONOMIES . THIS_RESEARCH also indicates that THE_ENHANCED_RESILIENCE
   of SUPPLY_CHAINS can produce A_MULTIPLIER_EFFECT , benefiting
   NOT_ONLY_INDIVIDUAL_FIRMS but also promoting ECONOMIC_STABILITY and GROWTH
   across MULTIPLE_COUNTRIES . 2024 by the authors .

AB SYSTEMS_ENGINEERING is AN_UBIQUITOUS_DISCIPLINE of ENGINEERING overlapping
   industrial , chemical , mechanical , MANUFACTURING , CONTROL , SOFTWARE ,
   electrical , and CIVIL_ENGINEERING . it provides TOOLS for dealing with
   THE_COMPLEXITY and DYNAMICS related to THE_OPTIMISATION of physical ,
   natural , and VIRTUAL_SYSTEMS_MANAGEMENT . this paper presents A_REVIEW of
   how MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS and COMPLEX_NETWORKS_THEORY are brought together to
   address SYSTEMS_ENGINEERING_AND_MANAGEMENT_PROBLEMS . THE_REVIEW also
   encompasses CURRENT_AND_FUTURE_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS both for
   THEORETICAL_FUNDAMENTALS and APPLICATIONS in THE_INDUSTRY . this is made by
   considering TRENDS such_as MESOSCALE , MULTISCALE , and MULTILAYER_NETWORKS
   along_with the STATE_OF_ART analysis on NETWORK_DYNAMICS and
   INTELLIGENT_NETWORKS . CRITICAL_AND_SMART_INFRASTRUCTURE ,
   MANUFACTURING_PROCESSES , and SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS are INSTANCES of
   RESEARCH_TOPICS for which THIS_LITERATURE_REVIEW is highly relevant . 2020

AB THE_OIL_AND_GAS_INDUSTRY ( OGI ) has always been associated with CHALLENGES
   and COMPLEXITIES . it involves MANY_PROCESSES and STAKEHOLDERS , each
   generating A_HUGE_AMOUNT of DATA . due_to THE_GLOBAL_AND_DISTRIBUTED_NATURE
   of THE_BUSINESS , PROCESSING and managing THIS_INFORMATION is
   AN_ARDUOUS_TASK . MANY_ISSUES such_as orchestrating DIFFERENT_DATA_SOURCES ,
   OWNERS and FORMATS . verifying , validating and securing DATA_STREAMS as
   they move along THE_COMPLEX_BUSINESS_PROCESS_PIPELINE . and getting INSIGHTS
   from DATA for improving BUSINESS_EFFICIENCY , SCHEDULING_MAINTENANCE and
   preventing THEFT and FRAUD are to be addressed . ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (
   AI ) , and MACHINE_LEARNING ( ML ) in_particular , have gained
   HUGE_ACCEPTANCE in MANY_AREAS recently , including THE_OGI , to help
   HUMANS_TACKLE_SUCH_COMPLEX_TASKS . furthermore , MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS ( MAS )
   as A_SUB_FIELD of DISTRIBUTED_AI meet THE_REQUIREMENT of DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEMS
   and have been utilised successfully in A_VAST_VARIETY of DISCIPLINES .
   SEVERAL_STUDIES have explored THE_USE of ML and MAS to increase
   OPERATIONAL_EFFICIENCY , manage SUPPLY_CHAIN and solve
   VARIOUS_PRODUCTION_AND_MAINTENANCE_RELATED_TASKS in THE_OGI . however , ML
   has only been applied to ISOLATED_TASKS , and while MAS have yielded
   GOOD_PERFORMANCE in SIMULATED_ENVIRONMENTS , they have not gained
   THE_EXPECTED_POPULARITY among OIL_AND_GAS_COMPANIES yet . FURTHER_RESEARCH
   in THE_FIELDS is necessary to realise THE_POTENTIAL of ML and MAS and
   encourage THEIR_WIDER_ACCEPTANCE in THE_OGI . in_particular , embedding ML
   into MAS can bring MANY_BENEFITS for THE_FUTURE_DEVELOPMENT of THE_INDUSTRY
   . this paper aims to summarise THE_EFFORTS to DATE of applying ML and MAS to
   OGI_TASKS , identify POSSIBLE_REASONS for THEIR_LOW_AND_SLOW_UPTAKE and
   suggest WAYS to ensure A_GREATER_ADOPTION of THESE_TECHNOLOGIES in THE_OGI .
