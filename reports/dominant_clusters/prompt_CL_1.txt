I am writing a paper about the dominant thematic clusters in multi-agent systems 
applied to city logistics, urban freight, and last-mile delivery. 

The secod dominant thematic cluster is defined by the following keywords and its relationships:

REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING; INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT; LEARNING_SYSTEMS;
HEURISTICS_AND_META_HEURISTICS; VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM;
COMPUTATIONAL_METHODS; DEEP_LEARNING; VEHICLES;
DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING; LEARNING_ALGORITHMS

Formulate a position or an opinion about the second thematic cluster based on the 
abstracts available in the attached file. The opinion describes the relationships
among the keywords and stablish a critical position about the cluster.

Be sure of formulating a deep opinion or deep position about the second thematic cluster.

Do not use surname (year) citation style. Use the Record-No value between brackets to indicate the reference to the
record. For example, [1] means that the information is in the Record-No
1. Use notes below of the generated text to justify the affirmation. Use
only phrases appearing in the provided text.

Use, at least, 20 abstracts for elaborate the critical review.
