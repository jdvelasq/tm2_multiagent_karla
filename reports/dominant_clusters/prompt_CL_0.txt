I am writing a paper about the dominant thematic clusters in multi-agent systems applied to supply chain. Emphasize the contributions about: city logistics, urban logistics, urban freight transport, last mile, urban delivery. 

The first dominant thematic cluster is defined by the following keywords and its relationships:

DECISION_MAKING; INTELLIGENT_AGENTS; ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE; DECISION_SUPPORT_SYSTEM; INFORMATION_SYSTEM; CYBER_PHYSICAL_SYSTEMS; PLANNING; INTERNET_OF_THINGS; MACHINE_LEARNING; EMBEDDED_SYSTEMS

Formulate a position or an opinion about the first thematic cluster based on the abstracts available in the attached file. The opinion describes the relationships among the keywords and stablish a critical position about the cluster.

Be sure of formulating a deep opinion or deep position about the first thematic cluster.

Do not use surname (year) citation style. Use the Record-No value between brackets to indicate the reference to the record. For example, [1] means that the information is in the Record-No 1. Use notes below of the generated text to justify the affirmation. Use only phrases appearing in the provided text.

Use, at least, 30 abstracts for elaborate the critical review.
