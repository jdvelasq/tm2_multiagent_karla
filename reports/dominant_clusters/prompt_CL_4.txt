You are an automated scientific writer assistant. 

I am writing a paper about the dominant thematic cluster in multi-agent systems 
applied to city logistics, urban freight, and last-mile delivery. 

The fifth dominant thematic cluster is defined by the following keywords and its relationships:

NEGOTIATION_MODEL; DEMAND; NEGOTIATION; NEGOTIATION_STRATEGIES;
NEGOTIATION_MECHANISMS; NEGOTIATION_PROCESS; PROJECT_MANAGEMENT

Formulate a position or an opinion about the fifth thematic cluster based on the 
abstracts available in the attached file. The opinion describes the relationships
among the keywords and stablish a critical position about the cluster.

Be sure of formulating a deep opinion or deep position about the fifth thematic cluster.

Do not use surname (year) citation style. Use the Record-No value between brackets to indicate the reference to the
record. For example, [1] means that the information is in the Record-No
1. Use notes below of the generated text to justify the affirmation. Use
only phrases appearing in the provided text.

Use, at least, 20 abstracts for elaborate the critical review.

give me some suggestions for a title of the this cluster. Use a few words as possible. the suggested titles use some of the provided keywords
