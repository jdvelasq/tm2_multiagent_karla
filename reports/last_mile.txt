AB DRONE_DELIVERY_SERVICES are promising , but THEIR_APPLICATION in
   TAKEAWAY_DELIVERY , along_with
   THE_RELATED_ECONOMIC_AND_ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACTS , remains underexplored . in
   this study , a MULTI_AGENT_BASED_SIMULATION_MODEL integrating DRONES ,
   ELECTRIC_BICYCLES ( E_BIKES ) , and TAKEAWAY_CABINETS was designed to
   simulate THE_TAKEAWAY_DELIVERY_PROCESS in A_REAL_SCENE and evaluate
   GREENHOUSE_GAS ( GHG ) emissions and ECONOMIC_BENEFITS under
   VARIOUS_DELIVERY_SCENARIOS . THE_RESULTS indicated that during THE_USE_PHASE
   , THE_GHG_EMISSIONS of DRONES were about 25 % 54 % higher than those of
   E_BIKES , but from_the_perspective_of LIFE_CYCLE , DRONE_DELIVERY showed
   CERTAIN_ENVIRONMENTAL_ADVANTAGES when delivering 1 or 2 ORDERS per FLIGHT ,
   with GHG_EMISSIONS 1 % 12 % lower than E_BIKE . DRONE_DELIVERY demonstrated
   SIGNIFICANTLY_HIGHER_EFFICIENCY and ECONOMICS , with POTENTIAL_REVENUES 78
   times that of E_BIKE_DELIVERY , and was expected to recover COSTS and
   achieve POSITIVE_RETURNS within TWO_YEARS . TAKEAWAY_CABINETS , however ,
   were MAJOR_CONTRIBUTORS to GHG_EMISSIONS during THE_USE_PHASE , accounting
   for 50 % 60 % of TOTAL_EMISSIONS , mainly due_to THE_CARBON_INTENSITY of
   ELECTRICITY . switching to CLEAN_ENERGY_SOURCES could reduce GHG_EMISSIONS
   by 60 % 70 % . THE_OPTIMAL_COLLABORATIVE_DELIVERY_SCENARIOS were affected by
   DELIVERY_DISTANCE , ENERGY_SOURCES , and the number of ORDERS per DELIVERY .

AB THE_INCREASING_DEMAND for EFFICIENT_LAST_MILE_DELIVERY , driven by THE_RISE
   of E_COMMERCE , has intensified THE_NEED for INNOVATIVE_SOLUTIONS to manage
   THE_COMPLEXITIES of URBAN_LOGISTICS . among the most pressing challenges are
   the MULTI_AGENT_PATHFINDING ( MAPF ) problem and COLLISION_AVOIDANCE , both
   of which are NP_HARD and critical for THE_SAFE_AND_EFFICIENT_OPERATION of
   DRONES . COLLISION_AVOIDANCE is particularly challenging due_to
   THE_EXPECTED_HIGH_DENSITY of DRONES in FUTURE_URBAN_ENVIRONMENTS , making it
   a problem that remains largely unsolved . TRADITIONAL_APPROACHES often rely
   on HEURISTIC_AND_METAHEURISTIC_METHODS to manage THESE_COMPLEXITIES , as
   LARGE_INSTANCES are beyond THE_REACH of EXACT_METHODS . additionally ,
   distributed RELAXATIONS to THESE_PROBLEMS can LEAD to SUBOPTIMAL_OUTCOMES
   and HIGHLIGHTS_THE_NEED for A_MORE_CENTRALIZED_AND_CONTROLLED_SOLUTION .
   THIS_RESEARCH adopts A_GRAPH_BASED_REPRESENTATION of THE_DELIVERY_AREA ,
   transforming the centralized LAST_MILE_DELIVERY_DRONES ( LMDD ) problem into
   A_NETWORK_FLOW_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEM . we propose
   TWO_GRAPH_BASED_NOVELTY_METHODS in LMDD , a purely exact ,
   NP_HARD_MIXED_INTEGER_LINEAR_PROGRAMMING ( MILP ) solution that_is evaluated
   against A_HEURISTIC . THE_COMPLEXITY of THE_HEURISTIC is bounded by o (
   p1.5k ) , where p represents THE_NUMBER of PERMITS and k is THE_NUMBER of
   DRONES . in_contrast , THE_COMPLEXITY of THE_MILP_MODEL is approximated by o
   ( k7p5.252k ) , making it intractable for LARGER_INSTANCES . THE_FINDINGS
   from SIMULATIONS indicate that THE_GRAPH based HEURISTIC effectively
   BALANCES_COMPUTATIONAL_EFFICIENCY and OPERATIONAL_RELIABILITY , making it a
   VIABLE_SOLUTION for REAL_WORLD_LMDD_APPLICATIONS , where LARGE_INSTANCES and

   , and PRODUCTION_DIVISIONS is essential for EFFECTIVE_SCHEDULING . for
   MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS in HETEROGENEOUS_SCS , it is crucial to have
   A_PRIOR_UNDERSTANDING of PRODUCTION , DELIVERY , and CONNECTIVITY . hence ,
   AN_INNOVATIVE_META_HEURISTIC_OPTIMIZATION inspired by SPARROW_BEHAVIOR is
   introduced as MULTI_AGENT_BASED_SCHEDULING_AND_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION ( MA_SRA

   WORKABLE_SCHEDULES in AN_SC with MULTIPLE_AGENTS are
   THE_PRIMARY_SIGNIFICANT_PROBLEMS focused on in this research .
   THE_MA_SRA_ALGORITHM provides AN_ACHIEVABLE_SOLUTION to THE_PROBLEM of

AB reducing EMISSIONS caused by URBAN_FREIGHT_TRANSPORTATION is

   THE_EMPIRICAL_BASIS is provided by AN_EXCEPTIONALLY_LARGE_DATASET of

   TRANSPORTATION_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEMS using
   AN_AUTOMATED_DATA_COLLECTION_INTERFACE . THE_DATASET is very dense and

   such_as sourcing , DISTRIBUTION_CHANNEL_CHOICE and SHIPMENT_SIZE_CHOICE . at

   THE_MULTI_AGENT_APPROACH allows to implement HETEROGENEOUS_PREFERENCES and

   SIMULATION_RESULTS show that VEHICLE_KILOMETERS travelled within
   THE_WIDER_REGION_INCREASE with THE_INTRODUCTION of UCC , and
   at_the_same_time THE_EFFICIENCY of DELIVERIES_INCREASES as well . thus

   THOSE_CITIZENS to deliver PARCELS on THEIR_WAY to THEIR_DESTINATIONS .
   THE_COMPLEXITY of THE_APPROACH lies in integrating
   THE_PUBLIC_INFRASTRUCTURE_NETWORK of THE_CITY for

   by CITIZENS can drastically reduce THE_EMISSIONS of CARBON_DIOXIDE and
