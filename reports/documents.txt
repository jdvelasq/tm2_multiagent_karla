AB A_CRITICAL_ISSUE in THE_OPERATION of ONE_WAY_STATION based
   SHARED_AUTONOMOUS_ELECTRIC_VEHICLES ( SAEVS ) is addressing
   THE_SUPPLYDEMAND_IMBALANCE . SUPPLY_SIDE_RELOCATIONS can transfer VEHICLES
   from AREAS with EXCESS_SUPPLY to AREAS with HIGHER_DEMAND , thereby
   satisfying MORE_PASSENGER_NEEDS and INCREASING_OPERATOR_PROFITS . to tackle
   THE_LIMITATIONS of CURRENT_ALGORITHMS , which fail to effectively capture
   SIMILAR_RELOCATION_ACTIONS through SPATIO_TEMPORAL_RELATIONSHIPS , this
   paper designs a zone based DYNAMIC_CLUSTERING driven
   MULTI_AGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_MODEL . THE_APPROACH uses
   DYNAMIC_CLUSTERING to pre CLUSTER_HISTORICAL_STATES for each TIME_STEP and
   classifies them in REAL_TIME during TRAINING_AND_TESTING .
   A_HETEROGENEOUS_ACTION_SPACE is designed , and AN_OPTIMIZATION_METHOD is
   employed to determine THE_SPECIFIC_VEHICLES for FINAL_RELOCATION , mapping
   THE_ACTIONS_TO_VEHICLE_RELOCATION . AN_ENTITY_AGENT reshaped ALGORITHM based
   on MULTI_AGENT_DEEP_DETERMINISTIC_POLICY_GRADIENT ( EAR_MADDPG ) is proposed
   , along_with TREATMENTS to ENHANCE_COOPERATION among AGENTS .
   EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS on the suzhou INDUSTRIAL_PARK ( SIP ) network
   demonstrate that the proposed method achieves BETTER_PERFORMANCE with
   FEWER_RELOCATIONS compared to rule BASED_RELOCATION and rl BASED_METHODS .
   the proposed method increases PROFIT by 11.80 % over THE_THRESHOLD_METHOD
   and by 4.25 % over THE_ADVANCED_STATIC_CLUSTERING_METHOD . 2025 elsevier ltd

AB GLOBAL_SUPPLY_CHAINS have become dynamic and complex over THE_PAST_YEARS ,

   A_KEY_PART of SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT . hence it is crucial to shift towards
   AGILE_AND_AUTOMATED_LOGISTICS_MODELS with THE_UTILIZATION of
   ADVANCED_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES . THE_SCOPE of
   THIS_PAPER is THE_USE of MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS for SELECTION of
   LOGISTICS_SERVICE_PROVIDERS in CARGO_SHIPPING . CARGOS are modeled within
   AUCTION_BASED_MECHANISMS to automate
   THE_SUPPLIER_SELECTION_AND_NEGOTIATION_PROCEDURE between
   A_CLIENT_AND_MULTIPLE_LOGISTICS_SERVICE_PROVIDERS to find THE_BEST_OFFER .
   FIPA_ENGLISH_AUCTION_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL is investigated to manage
   DIFFERENT_ACTIONS between THE_AGENTS , and A_NEW_MODEL is proposed by
   applying COMMUNICATION_ACTS of ( cancel , refuse , and FAILURE ) with
   DIFFERENT_LEVELS of CREDIBILITY ( low , moderate , and high ) . it was found
   that introducing AN_INDIVIDUAL_ACT into THE_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL can
   increase THE_NUMBER of INTERACTIONS between AGENTS from 24 to 26 up to 30
   in_case of introducing ALL_THE_THREE_ACTS into THE_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL .
   this means that THE_ENTIRE_SYSTEM will spend MORE_TIME and ENERGY in
   analyzing and responding to THE_ADDITIONAL_ACTS . it is concluded that
   THE_HIGHER_THE_CREDIBILITY , THE_LOWER_THE_INTERACTIONS between AGENTS as
   THE_SYSTEM will spend LESS_TIME and ENERGY in COMMUNICATION , which leads_to
   enhance THE_PERFORMANCE and THE_EFFICIENCY of THE_SYSTEM and THE_NETWORK .

AB THE_INCREASING_DEMAND for EFFICIENT_LAST_MILE_DELIVERY , driven by THE_RISE
   of E_COMMERCE , has intensified THE_NEED for INNOVATIVE_SOLUTIONS to manage
   THE_COMPLEXITIES of URBAN_LOGISTICS . among the most pressing challenges are
   the MULTI_AGENT_PATHFINDING ( MAPF ) problem and COLLISION_AVOIDANCE , both
   of which are NP_HARD and critical for THE_SAFE_AND_EFFICIENT_OPERATION of
   DRONES . COLLISION_AVOIDANCE is particularly challenging due_to
   THE_EXPECTED_HIGH_DENSITY of DRONES in FUTURE_URBAN_ENVIRONMENTS , making it

   distributed RELAXATIONS to THESE_PROBLEMS can LEAD to SUBOPTIMAL_OUTCOMES
   and HIGHLIGHTS_THE_NEED for A_MORE_CENTRALIZED_AND_CONTROLLED_SOLUTION .
   THIS_RESEARCH adopts A_GRAPH_BASED_REPRESENTATION of THE_DELIVERY_AREA ,
   transforming the centralized LAST_MILE_DELIVERY_DRONES ( LMDD ) problem into
   A_NETWORK_FLOW_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEM . we propose
   TWO_GRAPH_BASED_NOVELTY_METHODS in LMDD , a purely exact ,
   NP_HARD_MIXED_INTEGER_LINEAR_PROGRAMMING ( MILP ) solution that_is evaluated
   against A_HEURISTIC . THE_COMPLEXITY of THE_HEURISTIC is bounded by o (
   p1.5k ) , where p represents THE_NUMBER of PERMITS and k is THE_NUMBER of
   DRONES . in_contrast , THE_COMPLEXITY of THE_MILP_MODEL is approximated by o
   ( k7p5.252k ) , making it intractable for LARGER_INSTANCES . THE_FINDINGS
   from SIMULATIONS indicate that THE_GRAPH based HEURISTIC effectively
   BALANCES_COMPUTATIONAL_EFFICIENCY and OPERATIONAL_RELIABILITY , making it a

AB THE_BULLWHIP_EFFECT is one of THE_MOST_IMPORTANT_REASONS for reducing
   THE_PERFORMANCE of THE_SUPPLY_CHAIN ( SC ) and imposes MANY_COSTS on
   THE_INDUSTRY . VARIOUS_REASONS because_the BULLWHIP_EFFECT ( BWE ) , the
   most important of which are IMPROPER_CLASSIFICATION of ORDERS or
   PERIODIC_REVIEWS . THIS_PAPER first proposed THE_STATE_SPACE_MODEL of
   A_SUPPLY_CHAIN with A_PERIODIC_REVIEW_POLICY . we indicated that by
   categorizing and TIMING_ORDERS periodically with THE_CONCEPTS of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT , we reach A_THREE_AGENT_STRUCTURE with A_T_ORDER (
   cycle of ORDERS ) . THE_INTERACTION of THE_AGENTS in THIS_MODEL has
   A_SPANNING_TREE , so it was shown that THE_THREE_AGENT_APPROACH with T_ORDER
   can efficiently send OPTIMAL_PERIODIC_ORDERS to regulate and
   STABILIZE_DEMAND_FLUCTUATIONS . THE_AGENTS moved to
   AN_AGREED_INVENTORY_LEVEL by maintaining A_CERTAIN_DISTANCE from
   THEIR_INVENTORY with OTHER_AGENTS to adjust THE_BWE ( an example of swarming
   in MULTI_AGENT_CONTROL ) . due_to THE_EXISTENCE of STORAGE_COSTS and
   THE_DEMAND_FORECASTING that THE_PRODUCTION_AGENT adopts as THE_LEADER ,
   A_PROHIBITED_LEVEL of INVENTORY , should be taken into ACCOUNT , and AGENTS
   should avoid THESE_LEVELS . THIS_PROBLEM was solved using THE_DISCUSSION of
   avoiding OBSTACLES in MULTI_AGENT_CONTROL . finally , THE_EFFICIENCY of the
   proposed method was probed by simulating and expressing THE_EQUIVALENCE of

   solving THE_DISCRETE_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEM by fixing 0 1 variables . in the

   can be obtained . however , it is difficult to apply to LARGE_SCALE_PROBLEMS
   . in the proposed method 2 , we derive THE_SOLUTION of BINARY_VARIABLES by
   using LAGRANGIAN_DECOMPOSITION_AND_COORDINATION_APPROACH . the proposed
   method 2 can provide APPROXIMATE_SOLUTIONS for MORE_COMPLEX_PROBLEMS within

AB the covid 19 VACCINATION_MANAGEMENT in JAPAN has revealed MANY_PROBLEMS .
   THE_NUMBER of VACCINES available was clearly less than THE_NUMBER of PEOPLE
   who wanted to be vaccinated . initially , THE_SYSTEM was managed by making
   RESERVATIONS with AGE_GROUP utilizing VACCINATION_COUPONS . after
   THE_SECOND_ROUND of VACCINATIONS , ONLY_APPOINTMENTS for VACCINATION_DATES
   were coordinated and VACCINATION_SITES were set up in SHIBUYA_WARD where
   THE_VACCINE could be taken freely . under A_SHORTAGE of VACCINE_SUPPLY ,
   THE_INABILITY to make APPOINTMENTS arose from A_FAILURE to properly
   ESTIMATE_DEMAND . in_addition , THE_VACCINE expired due_to
   INADEQUATE_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT , resulting_in THE_VACCINE being discarded .
   this is considered to be A_SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROBLEM in which APPROPRIATE_SUPPLY
   could not be provided in response to DEMAND . in response to THIS_PROBLEM ,
   this paper examines whether it is possible to avoid SHORTAGE and
   STOCK_DISCARDS by A_DECENTRALIZED_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM for easy on
   SITE_INVENTORY_CONTROL instead_of A_CENTRALIZED_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM in
   REAL_WORLD . based on A_MULTI_AGENT_MODEL , A_MODEL was created to

   SCALABLE_ENVIRONMENT ( OFCOURSE ) in THE_OPENAI_GYM_STYLE , which allows

   SCANT_LITERATURE that studies THE_IMPACT of DELIVERY_LEAD_TIME on
   A_DUAL_CHANNEL_SUPPLY_CHAIN consisting of RETAILER and E_TAILER . this
   research paper uses GAME_THEORY to verify THE_IMPACT of DELIVERY_LEAD_TIME
   on PRICING_DECISIONS of A_HETEROGENEOUS_DUAL_CHANNEL_SUPPLY_CHAIN consisting
   of THE_MANUFACTURER , RETAILER , and E_TAILER . we used THE_STACKELBERG_GAME
   to study THE_MANUFACTURER s and downstream partners ' interaction :
   RETAILERS and E_TAILERS . A_HORIZONTAL_NASH_GAME was used to
   MODEL_THE_INTERACTION between THE_DOWNSTREAM_PARTNERS . we had analytically
   modeled how THE_LEAD_DELIVERY_TIME significantly affects
   THE_CHANNEL_PARTNER_OPTIMAL_PRICING , SALES_VOLUME , and PROFITABILITY . we
   also did SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS to check THE_INFLUENCE of the customers '
   CHANNEL_PREFERENCE_COEFFICIENT toward A_PARTICULAR_CHANNEL and
   ITS_CROSS_EFFECTS on THE_PRICING_POLICIES when THE_CUSTOMER is also
   LEAD_TIME sensitive . the study revealed that irrespective of
   LARGE_DELIVERY_TIME or next DAY_DELIVERY_TIME , customers ' preference
   toward A_PARTICULAR_CHANNEL did not affect THE_MANUFACTURER_PROFIT , whereas
   it affected THE_PROFIT of THE_RETAILER and E_TAILER . on_the_other_hand ,
   THE_INCREASE in LEAD_TIME_SENSITIVITY_COEFFICIENT severely affected
   THE_PROFIT of ALL_THE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_PARTNERS . by analyzing
   THE_PRICING_DECISIONS , we found that BOTH_THE_CUSTOMER_PREFERENCE and
   LEAD_TIME_SENSITIVITY_COEFFICIENTS affected THE_PRICING_DECISIONS , but
   customers ' CHANNEL_PREFERENCE_COEFFICIENT failed to mitigate THE_EFFECT of
   LEAD_DELIVERY_TIME . THE_INPUTS from this study can be used by practicing

AB CALIBRATION is AN_ESSENTIAL_PROCESS in making
   AN_AGENT_BASED_SIMULATOR_OPERATIONAL . in_particular , THE_CALIBRATION for
   FREIGHT_DEMAND is challenging because_of THE_MODEL_COMPLEXITY and
   THE_SHORTAGE of AVAILABLE_FREIGHT_DEMAND_DATA compared with PASSENGER_DATA .
   this paper proposes A_NOVEL_CALIBRATION_METHOD that relies solely on
   SCREENLINE_COUNTS , named SCREENLINE_BASED_TWO_STEP_CALIBRATION ( SLTC ) .
   SLTC consists of TWO_PARTS : ( 1 ) tour based DEMAND_ADJUSTMENT . and ( 2 )
   MODEL_PARAMETER_UPDATES . the former generates SCREENLINE_BASED_TOURS by
   cloning REMOVING_INSTANCES of THE_SIMULATED_GOODS_VEHICLE_TOURS , aiming to
   minimize THE_GAPS between THE_OBSERVED and the simulated SCREENLINE_COUNTS .
   THE_LATTER updates THE_PARAMETERS of THE_COMMODITY_FLOW_MODEL which
   GENERATES_INPUTS to SIMULATE_GOODS_VEHICLE_TOURS . to_demonstrate
   THE_PRACTICALITY of the proposed method , we apply it to AN_AGENT based
   URBAN_FREIGHT_SIMULATOR , SIMMOBILITY_FREIGHT . THE_RESULT shows that SLTC

AB the paper proposes A_METHOD for creating A_COMPUTER_AGENT for SUPPLY_CHAINS
   . THE_NOVELTY of THE_RESEARCH lies in THE_FACT that to increase

   THE_CONNECTIONIST_APPROACH instead_of using THE_CLASSICAL_PRODUCTION and
   LOGICAL_APPROACH . to expand THE_RANGE of TASKS solved by AGENTS , the

   based on PERCEPTION or A_SEQUENCE of PERCEPTIONS and A_PREVIOUS_ACTION or
   A_SEQUENCE of PREVIOUS_ACTIONS , as_well_as A_REACTIVE_AGENT with
   AN_INTERNAL_STATE and FEEDBACK , which is AN_EXTENSION of THE_REACTIVE_AGENT
   with AN_INTERNAL_STATE and makes A_DECISION based on PERCEPTION ,
   PREVIOUS_INTERNAL_STATE , and PREVIOUS_ACTION . for A_REACTIVE_AGENT with
   AN_INTERNAL_STATE and FEEDBACK , A_JORDAN_ELMAN_ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK
   was proposed , which is A_COMBINATION of JORDAN and ELMAN_NEURAL_NETWORKS ,
   and THE_STRUCTURE of ITS_MODEL was determined in THE_COURSE of
   A_NUMERICAL_STUDY . THE_EXPERIMENTS performed showed that when the
   NUMBER_OF_HIDDEN_NEURONS is not less than THE_NUMBER of NEURONS in
   THE_INPUT_LAYER , THE_VALUE of THE_ROOT_MEAN_SQUARE_ERROR does not change
   significantly , and THE_SELECTED_NETWORK gives RESULTS with A_MINIMUM_ERROR
   . METHODS for determining THE_PARAMETERS of

   possible to ENSURE_HIGH_SPEED and ACCURACY of CALCULATIONS based on

   A_NEW_METHODOLOGICAL_APPROACH is presented based on the
   MULTI_AGENT_PATH_PLANNING ( MAPP ) problem which is A_VARIANT of

   M_AGENTS that must visit N_TARGETS , THE_OPTIMAL_PATHS_PLAN ( A_SET of
   M_PATHS ) should be determined such_that EACH_TARGET is visited only once .
   minimizing THE_TIME of THIS_COOPERATIVE_OPERATION is THE_OPTIMIZATION_GOAL
   in this study . thus , THE_PLAN is optimal , if THE_LONGEST_PATH in THE_PLAN
   is the shortest possible ( MIN_MAX_PROBLEM ) . in_order_to deal with
   MORE_PRACTICAL_SITUATIONS , TWO_ADDITIONAL_CONSTRAINTS are applied :
   THE_MAXIMUM_NUMBER of TARGETS_EACH_AGENT is allowed to visit , and
   THE_MAXIMUM_RANGE for EACH_AGENT . accordingly , a so called
   CONSTRAINED_MULTI_AGENT_PATH_PLANNING ( CMAPP ) problem is elaborated in

   improves THE_PATHS using genetic like OPERATORS and a HEURISTIC_METHOD .
   THE_APPLICABILITY of THE_APPROXIMATE_SOLUTION was tested in

   THE_DEVELOPED_METHOD can be used for ROUTE_PLANNING of

   THE_AFOREMENTIONED_CHALLENGES in MULTI_PRODUCT ,
   MULTI_PERIOD_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT using DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (
   DEEP_RL ) . THE_PROPOSED_APPROACH improves upon EXISTING_METHODS for

   A_LARGE_NUMBER ( HUNDREDS ) of PRODUCTS under REALISTIC_CONSTRAINTS , ( 2 )

   handling of MULTI_PERIOD_CONSTRAINTS that stem from DIFFERENT_LEAD_TIMES of

   satisfactorily solved using CLASSICAL_OPTIMISATION_TECHNIQUES . subsequently
   , we formulate THE_PROBLEM in A_GENERAL_FRAMEWORK that can be used for

AB THE_OPTION of decarbonizing URBAN_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT using
   BATTERY_ELECTRIC_VEHICLE ( BEV ) seems promising . however , there is
   currently A_STRONG_DEBATE whether FUEL_CELL_ELECTRIC_VEHICLE ( FCEV ) might
   be THE_BETTER_SOLUTION . THE_QUESTION arises as to how A_FLEET of
   FCEV_INFLUENCES the operating cost , the GREENHOUSE_GAS ( GHG ) emissions
   and PRIMARY_ENERGY_DEMAND in_comparison to bevs and to
   INTERNAL_COMBUSTION_ENGINE_VEHICLE ( ICEV ) . to investigate this , we
   simulate THE_URBAN_FOOD_RETAILING as A_REPRESENTATIVE_SHARE of
   URBAN_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT using A_MULTI_AGENT_TRANSPORT_SIMULATION_SOFTWARE .
   SYNTHETIC_ROUTES as_well_as FLEET_SIZE and COMPOSITION are determined by
   solving A_VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM . we compute THE_OPERATING_COSTS using a
   TOTAL_COST_OF_OWNERSHIP analysis and THE_USE_PHASE_EMISSIONS as_well_as
   PRIMARY_ENERGY_DEMAND using the WELL_TO_WHEEL_APPROACH . while A_CHANGE to
   BEV_RESULTS in 1723 % higher COSTS compared to ICEV , using FCEVS leads_to
   2257 % higher COSTS . assuming TODAY_ELECTRICITY_MIX , we show
   A_GHG_EMISSION_REDUCTION of 25 % compared to THE_ICEV_BASE_CASE when using
   BEV . CURRENT_HYDROGEN_PRODUCTION leads_to A_GHG_REDUCTION of 33 % when
   using FCEV which however cannot be scaled to LARGER_FLEETS . using
   CURRENT_ELECTRICITY in ELECTROLYSIS will increase GHG_EMISSION by 60 %
   compared to THE_BASE_CASE . assuming 100 % RENEWABLE_ELECTRICITY for
   charging and HYDROGEN_PRODUCTION , THE_REDUCTION from FCEVS_RISES to 73 %
   and from BEV to 92 % . THE_PRIMARY_ENERGY_REQUIREMENT for BEV is in
   ALL_CASES lower and for higher compared to THE_BASE_CASE . we conclude that
   while FCEV have A_SLIGHTLY_HIGHER_GHG_SAVINGS_POTENTIAL with
   CURRENT_HYDROGEN , BEV are THE_FAVORED_TECHNOLOGY for
   URBAN_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT from AN_ECONOMIC_AND_ECOLOGICAL_POINT of VIEW ,

AB SAME_DAY_DELIVERY ( SDD ) services have become increasingly popular in

   A_CERTAIN_CLASS of DYNAMIC_VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM ( DVRP ) where GOODS must
   be delivered from A_DEPOT to a SET_OF_CUSTOMERS in THE_SAME_DAY that
   THE_ORDERS were placed . ADAPTIVE_EXACT_SOLUTION_METHODS for dvrps can
   become intractable even for SMALL_PROBLEM_INSTANCES . in this paper ,
   THE_SAME_DAY_DELIVERY_PROBLEM ( SDDP ) is formulated as
   A_MARKOV_DECISION_PROCESS ( MDP ) and it is solved using
   A_PARAMETER_SHARING_DEEP_Q_NETWORK , which corresponds to a
   DECENTRALISED_MULTI_AGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING ( MARL ) approach . for
   this , A_MULTI_AGENT_GRID_BASED_SDD_ENVIRONMENT is created , consisting of
   MULTIPLE_VEHICLES , a CENTRAL_DEPOT , and DYNAMIC_ORDER_GENERATION .
   in_addition , ZONE_SPECIFIC_ORDER_GENERATION_AND_REWARD_PROBABILITIES are
   introduced . THE_PERFORMANCE of THE_PROPOSED_MARL_APPROACH is compared
   against a MIXED_INTEGER_PROGRAMMING ( MIP ) solution . RESULTS show that
   THE_PROPOSED_MARL_FRAMEWORK performs on PAR with MIP_BASED_POLICY when
   THE_NUMBER of ORDERS is relatively low . for PROBLEM_INSTANCES with
   HIGHER_ORDER_ARRIVAL_RATES , COMPUTATIONAL_RESULTS show that the
   MARL_APPROACH_UNDERPERFORMS_MIP by up to 30 % . THE_PERFORMANCE_GAP between
   BOTH_METHODS becomes smaller when ZONE_SPECIFIC_PARAMETERS are employed .
   THE_GAP is reduced from 30 % to 3 % for a 5 3 5 GRID_SCENARIO with 30 ORDERS
   . EXECUTION_TIME_RESULTS indicate that THE_MARL_APPROACH is , on average ,
   65 times faster than THE_MIP_BASED_POLICY , and therefore may be more
   advantageous for REAL_TIME_CONTROL , at_least for SMALL_SIZED_INSTANCES .

AB A_VIRTUOUS_CYCLE of the GREEN_TECHNOLOGY_INNOVATION ( GTI ) system ( GTIS )
   can not only effectively serve GTI_SUBJECTS in THE_SYSTEM but also fully

   of THE_GTIS_EVOLUTION of MANUFACTURING_ENTERPRISES ( MES ) under
   MULTI_AGENT_COOPERATION ( MEUMAC ) is encouraged by GOVERNMENTS and led by
   MES , which jointly promote THE_PROCESS of GTIS from LOW_END to HIGH_END
   through INTERACTION with UNIVERSITIES , RESEARCH_INSTITUTIONS ,
   SUPPLY_CHAINS , INTERMEDIARIES and CONSUMERS . MES cooperate with
   MULTIPLE_GTI_SUBJECTS to continuously improve THE_GTI_LEVEL of MEUMAC , and
   THE_SUBSYSTEMS of THE_GTIS_INTERACT and coordinate dynamically . to promote
   THE_UPGRADE of THE_GTIS under MULTI_AGENT_COOPERATION ,
   THE_DYNAMIC_CO_EVOLUTION_MECHANISM of THE_GTIS needs to be explored .
   INNOVATION_PROCESS is A_VALUE_CHAIN that transforms from
   KNOWLEDGE_CREATION_TO_PRODUCT_PROMOTION based on THE_INNOVATION_VALUE_CHAIN
   . based on SYSTEM_THEORY , THIS_PROCESS can be solved through FIVE_PARTS :
   INPUT , PROCESSING , OUTPUT , FEEDBACK and UPGRADE .
   THE_STRUCTURE_AND_EVOLUTION_PATH of THE_GTIS were analysed based on
   THE_INNOVATION_VALUE_CHAIN_THEORY and SYSTEM_THEORY .
   LOGISTIC_SYMBIOTIC_RESPONSE_SYSTEM is A_TYPICAL_SYSTEM with
   SELF_ORGANIZATION_CHARACTERISTICS , and THE_DEVELOPMENT_LAW of THE_GTIS of
   MEUMAC is similar with THE_SYMBIOTIC_SYSTEM . hence , an EVOLUTION_MODEL
   based on A_LOGISTIC_MODEL was constructed to determine

   THE_GTIS of MEUMAC is THE_SPATIAL_ADVANCEMENT and TEMPORAL_EVOLUTION of
   THE_SYSTEM under THE_ACTION of INTERNAL_AND_EXTERNAL_SUBJECTS , which is
   ultimately manifested as THE_PROCESS of THE_GTI_PERFORMANCE_OUTPUT .
   THE_OPERATION_STATUS of GREEN_TECHNOLOGY is A_KEY_FACTOR in

AB VALUE_CHAIN is identified as THE_GENERATOR of THE_METABOLIC_RIFT between
   NATURE and SOCIETY . however , THE_SUSTAINABLE_VALUE_CHAIN can mitigate and
   reverse THIS_RIFT . in this paper , firstly , a review of
   THE_MAIN_DIGITAL_ENABLERS of INDUSTRY 4.0 and THE_CURRENT_STATE of
   COGNITIVE_MANUFACTURING is carried out . secondly , CYBER_PHYSICAL_SYSTEMS
   are conceived from THE_HOLONIC_PARADIGM , as AN_ORGANIZATIONAL_ENABLER for
   THE_WHOLE of ENABLERS . thirdly , THE_BIJECTIVE_RELATIONSHIP between
   HOLONIC_PARADIGM and CONTAINER_BASED_TECHNOLOGY is analyzed .
   THIS_TECHNOLOGY allows mapping THE_PHYSICAL_AND_VIRTUAL_HOLON as
   AN_INTELLIGENT_AGENT embodied at THE_EDGE , FOG and CLOUD_LEVEL , with
   PHYSICAL_AND_VIRTUAL_PART . finally , THE_PROPOSED_HOLONIC_SYSTEM based on
   THE_CYBER_PHYSICAL_HOLON is developed through MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS based on
   CONTAINER_TECHNOLOGY . THE_PROPOSED_SYSTEM allows to MODEL_THE_METABOLISM of
   MANUFACTURING_SYSTEMS , from A_CELL_MANUFACTURING to WHOLE_VALUE_CHAIN ,
   in_order_to develop , evolve and improve THE_SUSTAINABLE_VALUE_CHAIN . 2021

AB EFFICIENT_OPERATION of SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEMS by means of

   THE_AVAILABILITY of CUSTOMER_DEMAND_PREDICTIONS , which are assumed to be
   reliable to SOME_EXTENT ,

   SUPPLY_CHAIN_OPERATION are proposed , analyzed and investigated in
   NUMERICAL_SIMULATIONS . THE_MECHANISMS employed for INFORMATION_EXCHANGE
   throughout THE_SUPPLY_CHAIN differ in BOTH_APPROACHES .
   THE_FIRST_APPROACH_ESTABLISHES and implements THE_EXCHANGE of
   SEMI_ACCURATE_PREDICTIONS , which explicitly requires predicted TRAJECTORIES
   to only vary slightly from ONE_TIME_STEP to the next . in
   THE_SECOND_APPROACH , INFORMATION_EXCHANGE is rather indirect by means of
   TERMINAL_CONSTRAINTS in THE_LOCAL_MPC_FORMULATIONS , explicitly relying on
   THE_STOCK and FLOW_NATURE of THE_OVERALL_SYSTEM . THE_TWO_APPROACHES
   considerably differ in_terms_of SYSTEM_SETUP , REQUIREMENTS and
   CORRESPONDING_RESULTS , and hence provide A_FLEXIBLE_FRAMEWORK for
   leveraging PREDICTIVE_INFORMATION in SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT .

   derive THE_BRAND_OWNER_OPTIMAL_CONTRACTS and the AGENTS ' EFFORT_LEVELS and
   conduct EXTENSIVE_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSES regarding THE_INFLUENCES of

   CUSTOMER_SATISFACTION can bring SIGNIFICANT_BENEFIT to
   THE_FIRM_PROFITABILITY , and explore how it is affected by SYSTEM_FACTORS .
   specifically , THE_BENEFIT is more substantial when THE_MARGINAL_COST of
   QUALITY_CONTROL_EFFORT is relatively smaller than THE_MARGINAL_COST of
   SALES_EFFORT . AN_INTERESTING_DISCOVERY is that THE_BRAND_OWNER always earns
   MORE_PROFIT by OUTSOURCING_BUSINESS to MULTIPLE_AGENTS than to
   A_SINGLE_AGENT , mainly because_of HIS_INFLEXIBILITY in reaching A_BALANCE

   case of SOME_SUBCHAINS suffering from PRODUCTION_INTERRUPTION , or losing

AB COOPERATION among DIFFERENT_VEHICLES is A_PROMISING_CONCEPT for
   MOBILITY_AS_A_SERVICE ( MAAS ) . A_PRINCIPAL_PROBLEM in MAAS is optimizing
   THE_VEHICLE_ROUTES to reduce THE_TOTAL_TRAVEL_COST with COOPERATION .
   for_example , we know that platooning among LARGE_TRUCKS could reduce
   THE_FUEL_COST because it decreases THE_AIR_RESISTANCE . TRADITIONAL_PLATOONS
   , however , cannot MODEL_COOPERATION among DIFFERENT_TYPES of VEHICLES
   because_the MODEL_ASSUMES_THE_HOMOGENEITY of VEHICLE_TYPES . we then propose

   include A_LOGISTIC_SCENARIO , where A_TRUCK for THE_LONG_DISTANCE_DELIVERY
   also carries SMALL_SELF_DRIVING_VEHICLES for THE_LAST_MILE_DELIVERY . for

   SUPPLY_CHAINS , they do not adequately support MULTIPLE_STAKEHOLDERS to
   collaboratively create and explore A_VARIETY of DECISION_MAKING_SCENARIOS .

AB RESEARCH on THE_INTEGRITY of SUPPLY_CHAIN_DECISIONS is constantly increasing

   LITTLE_STUDY when MULTIPLE_AGENTS affect THE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DECISIONS . in

AB getting ENTERPRISES to reduce CARBON_EMISSIONS cooperatively is

   in THE_SUPPLY_CHAIN . the main goal of this paper is to provide
   A_POTENTIAL_METHOD for THE_CORE_ENTERPRISE to organize THIS_COOPERATION
   successfully . we explore how CORE_ENTERPRISES should allocate
   THEIR_REDUCTION_INVESTMENTS and coordinate THE_SELECTION of
   TECHNOLOGY_UPGRADE_STRATEGIES so_as_to maximize THEIR_PROFITS without
   disrupting THE_PROFITS of cooperating ENTERPRISES for A_SUPPLY_CHAIN where
   there are NON_EQUIVALENT_RELATIONSHIPS between ENTERPRISES .
   THE_MAIN_HYPOTHESES are that EACH_ENTERPRISE only produces ONE_PRODUCT , and
   EACH_PRODUCTION_PROCESS in EACH_ENTERPRISE can only select
   ONE_PRODUCTION_TECHNOLOGY , and THE_INTERMEDIATE_PRODUCTS are mainly traded
   among COOPERATIVE_ENTERPRISES . A_MODEL based on
   INDEPENDENT_CARBON_EMISSION_REDUCTION ( MODEL_I ) is first constructed and
   used to analyze each ENTERPRISES ' BASIC_INFORMATION when they reduce
   CARBON_EMISSION without COOPERATION ( considering TOTAL_COSTS , PROFITS ,
   and so on ) . then , based on THIS_INFORMATION , A_MODEL including
   COOPERATION is proposed ( MODEL_II ) . in MODEL_II , THE_ENTERPRISES are
   divided into CORE_AND_COOPERATIVE_ENTERPRISES and BOTH_CAPITAL and

AB purpose : the purpose of this paper is to explore THE_DOER_EFFECT of

   OVERALL_CUSTOMER_SATISFACTION_AND_REPURCHASE_INTENTIONS for MULTI_AGENTS in
   TOURISM_SERVICE_SUPPLY_CHAIN ( TSSC ) . it specifically focuses on
   INTERNAL_AND_EXTERNAL_FAILURE and RECOVERY . design methodology approach :
   the study employs a 223 between SUBJECTS_EXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN with 12
   DIVERSE_SCENARIOS . it aims to examine THE_MAIN_EFFECTS of GPE and
   THE_INTERACTION_EFFECTS of SF and RECOVERY on
   OVERALL_CUSTOMER_SATISFACTION_AND_REPURCHASE_INTENTIONS . findings :
   THE_MAIN_FINDINGS show that CONSUMERS do not show
   FAVORABLE_BEHAVIORAL_OUTCOMES when they have GPE with AN_AFFILIATED_PARTY .
   RESULTS of THE_EXPERIMENTS demonstrate that for HOTELS , there is
   NO_INTERACTION_EFFECT between FAILURE and RECOVERY regarding
   OVERALL_CUSTOMER_SATISFACTION_AND_REPURCHASE_INTENTIONS . however , for
   TRAVEL_AGENCIES , AN_INTERACTION_EFFECT has been found . this indicates that
   AN_INTERNAL_FAILURE ( by TRAVEL_AGENCY ) should be recovered internally to
   increase THE_BEHAVIORAL_OUTCOMES for TRAVEL_AGENCY . however , if there is
   AN_EXTERNAL_FAILURE ( by HOTEL ) then THE_ESSENTIAL_THING is providing
   A_RECOVERY . originality value : although THE_SERVICE_LITERATURE covers
   FAILURE and RECOVERY in DIVERSE_CONTEXTS , THESE_CONCEPTS are rarely studied
   from A_MULTI_AGENT_PERSPECTIVE in THE_SERVICE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_LITERATURE . in
   SUCH_A_CHAIN , A_FAILURE by A_DIFFERENT_PARTY may remain unresolved , and
   this may create A_POSITIVE_EFFECT on ANOTHER_PARTY , if they provide
   RECOVERY for THE_FAILURE . this means that the doer of THE_FAILURE and or
   RECOVERY ( THE_PARTY responsible from THE_FAILURE and or RECOVERY ) may have
   AN_IMPACT on BEHAVIORAL_OUTCOMES . however , PREVIOUS_LITERATURE has
   neglected to focus on THE_IMPORTANT_ISSUE of which

AB recently , A_LOT of ATTENTION has been brought to
   THE_DEEP_SPACE_MINING_MISSIONS . MINING of THE_NATURAL_RESOURCES from near
   EARTH_CELESTIAL_BODIES like MOON , near EARTH_ASTEROIDS ( NEAS ) , COMETS
   and METEORS is one of THE_POSSIBLE_WAYS for solving of THE_PROBLEM of LACK
   of NATURAL_RESOURCES on EARTH . THE_CALCULATIONS in THE_ARTICLE show that

   not allow US to implement EXTRATERRESTRIAL_RESOURCES to EARTH_ECONOMY ,
   due_to THE_EXTREMELY_HIGH_COST comparing to THE_TERRESTRIAL_RESOURCES .
   THE_GOAL of THIS_PAPER is to ESTIMATE_ECONOMICAL_BENEFITS of ASTEROID_MINING
   for MOON_AND_MARS_COLONIES . we know from PLANETARY_RESEARCH_PROGRAMS that
   WATER_RESOURCES on THE_MOON are limited and most of them are possibly

   concentrated near THE_POLAR_REGIONS in FORM of ICE ( polar layered deposits
   ) or near SURFACE_PERMAFROST . in_order_to enable in

   A_NUMBER of ADDITIONAL_MATERIALS have to be brought to THE_MOON or MARS . we
   propose to consider A_NETWORK_ECONOMY that includes near EARTH_ASTEROIDS (
   NEA ) , EARTH , MOON , ASTEROID_BELT , MARS and ITS_SATELLITES as A_SOURCE
   of MATERIALS for SOLAR_SYSTEM_COLONIZATION . for_example , MATERIALS
   contained in NEA may be very useful to THIS_TASK . approximately 10 % of
   KNOWN_NEAS are more accessible than THE_MOON in_terms_of REQUIRED_DELTA_V

   THE_UDDI_CLOUD_LEVEL and THE_AGENT_LEVEL . THE_UDDI_CLOUD_LEVEL allows

AB CLOUD_SERVICE_COMPOSITION is required when SINGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE cannot
   satisfy ALL_REQUIREMENTS of THE_USER . CLOUD_SERVICE_COMPOSITION presents an
   EFFICIENT_MANAGERIAL , on DEMAND and SCALABLE_WAY to integrate
   COMPUTATIONAL_RESOURCES ( HARDWARE , PLATFORM , and SOFTWARE ) . it includes
   SEVERAL_TASKS such_as DISCOVERY , SELECTION , and DEPLOYMENT of THE_SERVICES
   . in this paper , AN_AGENT_BASED_APPROACH for CLOUD_SERVICE_NEGOTIATION is
   proposed . AGENT_BASED_TECHNOLOGY has hailed as A_NEW_PARADIGM for
   implementing SOFTWARE_AGENTS . SOFTWARE_AGENTS are AUTONOMOUS_ENTITIES which
   act on BEHALF of USER across OPEN_AND_DISTRIBUTED_ENVIRONMENTS .
   A_MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM for CLOUD_SERVICE_COMPOSITION makes use of
   A_MARKET_ORIENTED_APPROACH which would regulate DEMAND_AND_SUPPLY_CHAIN .
   this work involves creating SERVICE_PROVIDER_AGENTS and CONSUMER_AGENTS .
   THE_RESOURCES offered by THE_SERVICE_PROVIDERS are created as
   VIRTUAL_MACHINES in CLOUD that would be mapped to THE_CONSUMERS .
   THE_CONSUMER_AGENT gets THE_INPUT from THE_USER and finds
   THE_BEST_SERVICE_PROVIDERS who satisfy THE_CONSUMER_CONSTRAINTS .
   CONSUMER_AGENT further establishes A_NEGOTIATION between
   THESE_SERVICE_PROVIDERS and purchases THE_CLOUD_SERVICES for
   MARKET_FAVORABLE_COST . THE_CONSUMER_AND_SERVICE_PROVIDER_AGENTS communicate
   using CONTRACT_NET_PROTOCOL , which is A_TASK_SHARING_PROTOCOL in
   MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM . THE_WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE of this
   FRAMEWORK_INVOLVES_INTERACTION and NEGOTIATION of
   THE_CONSUMER_AND_SERVICE_PROVIDER_AGENTS . also , A_MATHEMATICAL_MODEL has
   been proposed to support MARKET_DRIVEN_APPROACH in CLOUD_COMMERCE . 2016

AB abstract in the present , global and COMPETITIVE_MARKET_CUSTOMER_DEMANDS are
   very volatile . it is very difficult for SMALL_AND_MEDIUM_SIZE_ENTERPRISES (
   SMES ) to satisfy THEIR_CUSTOMER with QUALITY_PRODUCT in REASONABLE_PRICE .
   LARGE_FIRMS are spending HUGE_AMOUNT of THEIR_BUDGET in generating
   TECHNOLOGY_DEVELOPMENT . to cope with THIS_COMPETITIVE_MARKET , usually ,
   SMES concentrate on THEIR_CORE_EXPERTISE and outsource SOME_NON_CORE_ITEMS
   or ACTIVITIES . THE_OUTSOURCING_DECISION ( when , what , whom ) is very
   crucial for SMALL_SCALE_INDUSTRIES . realizing THIS_SCENARIO , in this
   article , AN_AUTOMATED_SELF_ADAPTIVE_MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM has been proposed .
   THE_PROPOSED_SYSTEM will help SMES to take AN_APPROPRIATE_DECISION to
   mitigate THE_UNCERTAINTY in SUPPLY_CHAIN . THE_DEVELOPED_SYSTEM exploits the
   " OUTSOURCING of OPERATIONS " feature by ITS_AGENTS to_conclude
   THE_MANUFACTURING_PROCESSES faster and reduce THE_IDLE_TIME of
   CERTAIN_MACHINES with LESS_HUMAN_INTERVENTION . THE_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL
   for AGENTS has been described to give AN_INSIGHT of THEIR_COMMUNICATION . it
   was explained HOW_VARIOUS_AGENTS like OUTSOURCING , MATERIAL_PLANNING and
   SUPPLIER_SELECTION will come into ACTION at DIFFERENT_STAGES and take

AB CONSUMER_DEMAND for REGIONALLY_PRODUCED_FOOD has increased dramatically in
   THE_PAST_DECADE , in response to CONCERNS over FOOD_SAFETY and QUALITY ,
   as_well_as the SERIOUS_ENVIRONMENTAL , economic , and SOCIAL_EQUITY_ISSUES
   that pervade THE_MODERN_INDUSTRIAL_FOOD_SUPPLY_SYSTEM . as DEMAND grows ,
   distributors of REGIONALLY_PRODUCED_FOOD ( i . E . , FOOD_HUBS ) face
   MANY_CHALLENGES in THEIR_EFFORTS to scale up , particularly with
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT . they must find WAYS to operate more efficiently
   without undermining THEIR_SUPPORT for THE_REGIONAL_FARMING_COMMUNITY . in
   this paper we describe A_MULTI_AGENT_SIMULATION_MODEL of
   A_THEORETICAL_REGIONAL_FOOD_SYSTEM in which MULTIPLE_FARMERAGENTS produce
   FOOD , negotiate with A_REGIONAL_FOOD_HUB_AGENT , and try to sell THEIR_FOOD
   at THE_BEST_POSSIBLE_PRICE . using THIS_MODEL , we compare THE_EFFECTS of
   VARIOUS_FOOD_HUB_SUPPLIER_SELECTION_POLICIES on SYSTEM_OUTCOMES ,
   in_terms_of FOOD_HUB_PROFITABILITY , the cost of QUALITY , TRANSACTION_COSTS
   , the number of FARMERS required to satisfy DEMAND , and the
   SIZE_DISTRIBUTION of THESE_FARMERS . RESULTS suggest that
   THE_FOOD_HUB_SELECTION_POLICY significantly impacts
   LONG_TERM_SYSTEM_PERFORMANCE .

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT ( SCM ) is A_VERY_CHALLENGING_PROBLEM that US
   leveraging THE_E_COMMERCE_EXPLOSION . TODAY_SUPPLY_CHAINS are essentially
   static , because they rely on LONG_TERM_RELATIONSHIP among
   KEY_TRADING_PARTNERS . DYNAMIC_PRACTICES are vital because they offer
   BETTER_MATCHES between SUPPLIERS and CUSTOMERS as MARKET_CONDITIONS change .
   MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS ( MAS ) offer NEW_PERSPECTIVES compared to conventional
   , centrally organized architectures in THE_SCOPE of SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT
   ( SCM ) . THEIR_STRUCTURE inherently meets THE_REQUIREMENTS of
   DECENTRALIZED_SUPPLY_CHAINS , whereas CONVENTIONAL_SCM_SYSTEMS are often
   restricted in_terms_of DYNAMIC_BEHAVIOR , handling SEVERE_DISTURBANCES at
   SUPPLIER_SITES as_well_as dealing with HIGHLY_CUSTOMIZED_OR_COMPLEX_PRODUCTS
   . since NECESSARY_DATA are not available within THE_WHOLE_SUPPLY_CHAIN ,
   AN_INTEGRATED_APPROACH to PRODUCTION_PLANNING_AND_CONTROL taking into
   ACCOUNT_ALL_THE_PARTNERS involved is not feasible . in this paper
   A_MAS_ARCHITECTURE integrating VARIOUS_INTELLIGENT_AGENT_SYSTEMS is
