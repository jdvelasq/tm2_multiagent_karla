AB this ARTICLE_DEMONSTRATES the application of a NOVEL_MULTIAGENT MODELING
   approach to support SUPPLY_NETWORK CONFIGURATION (snc) decisions toward
   addressing several challenges reported in the literature.  these challenges
   include: enhancing SUPPLY_NETWORK (sn)_level PERFORMANCE in alignment with
   the GOALS of INDIVIDUAL_SN_ENTITIES; addressing the issue of limited
   INFORMATION_SHARING between SN_ENTITIES; and sustaining COMPETITIVENESS of
   sns in DYNAMIC_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENTS. to this end, a multistage,
   MULTIECHELON_SN consisting of geographically dispersed SN_ENTITIES catering
   to distinct product_market profiles was modeled.  in MODELING the
   SNC_DECISION_PROBLEM, two types of AGENTS, each having DISTINCT_ATTRIBUTES
   and FUNCTIONS, were used.  the MODELING approach incorporated a
   reverse_auctioning PROCESS to simulate the behavior of SN_ENTITIES with
   differing INDIVIDUAL_GOALS collectively contributing to enhance sn_level
   PERFORMANCE, by means of setting RESERVE_VALUES generated through the
   application of a GENETIC_ALGORITHM. a set of pareto_optimal sncs catering to
   distinct product_market profiles was generated using nondominated sorting
   GENETIC_ALGORITHM_II. further EVALUATION of these sncs against
   ADDITIONAL_CRITERIA, using a rule_based approach, allowed the selection of
   the most APPROPRIATE_SNC to meet a broader set of conditions.  the MODEL was
   tested using a REFRIGERATOR_SN_CASE_STUDY drawn from the literature.  the
   results reveal that a number of SNC_DECISIONS can be supported by the
   proposed MODEL, in particular, identifying and evaluating ROBUST_SNS to suit
   varied product_market profiles, enhancing SC_CAPABILITIES to withstand
   DISRUPTIONS and developing contingencies to recover from DISRUPTIONS.

AB ROBOTIC_MANUFACTURING systems are essential in the post_pandemic world owing
   to their HIGH_LEVEL of FLEXIBILITY and AUTOMATION during a LABOR_CRISIS.
   however, designing a SUITABLE_ROBOTIC MANUFACTURING_SYSTEM for small_ and
   mid_sized ENTERPRISES (SMES) is challenging, considering both their
   FINANCIAL_BURDENS and the CURRENT SUPPLY_CHAIN_DISRUPTIONS of
   COMPONENT_SUPPLIERS. to address these challenges, this study proposes a
   distributed multi_agent COLLABORATIVE_CONCEPTUAL_DESIGN method involving
   designers and SUPPLIERS to assist SMES in implementing ROBOTIC_MANUFACTURING
   systems.  first, we propose a COMMON_DATA_MODEL that enables
   KNOWLEDGE_INTERACTION between DIFFERENT_AGENTS during
   COLLABORATIVE_CONCEPTUAL_DESIGN. subsequently, based on the proposed
   DATA_MODEL, the agent_based COLLABORATIVE_CONCEPTUAL_DESIGN_PROCESS is
   developed, which enables DIFFERENT_AGENTS to communicate, interact, and
   negotiate with each other according to their experiences and KNOWLEDGE.
   third, an INTEGRATIVE_ALGORITHM based on 2_additive FUZZY measures,
   CHOQUET_INTEGRAL, and stochastic multi_criteria acceptability analysis is
   implemented to support the multi_agent decision_making PROCESS to robustly
   SELECT_ARCHITECTURE_ALTERNATIVES. as a CASE_STUDY, a
   REAL_INDUSTRIAL_DESIGN_PROJECT of a ROBOTIC_MANUFACTURING SYSTEM required by
   our INDUSTRIAL_PARTNER, is adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed method.  2023 ELSEVIER_LTD

AB the multi_depot VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM (mdvrp) is one of the most essential
   and USEFUL_VARIANTS of the TRADITIONAL_VEHICLE ROUTING_PROBLEM (vrp) in
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM) and LOGISTICS_STUDIES. many SUPPLY_CHAINS (SC)
   choose the JOINT_DISTRIBUTION of MULTIPLE_DEPOTS to cut TRANSPORTATION_COSTS
   and DELIVERY_TIMES. however, the ability to deliver quality and
   FAST_SOLUTIONS for mdvrp remains a CHALLENGING_TASK.
   TRADITIONAL_OPTIMIZATION_APPROACHES in OPERATION_RESEARCH (or) may not be
   practical to solve mdvrp in real_time.  with the latest developments in
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai), it becomes feasible to apply
   DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (drl) for solving combinatorial
   ROUTING_PROBLEMS. this paper proposes a new multi_agent
   DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (madrl) MODEL to solve mdvrp.
   EXTENSIVE_EXPERIMENTS are conducted to evaluate the PERFORMANCE of the

AB purpose: academics and practitioners have long acknowledged the potential of
   MULTIAGENT_SYSTEMS (MAS) to automate and autonomize decision_making in
   LOGISTICS and SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS. despite the manifold promises of MAS,
   INDUSTRY_ADOPTION is lagging behind, and the EXACT_BENEFITS of these systems
   remain unclear.  this STUDY_AIMS to fill this KNOWLEDGE_GAP by analyzing 11
   SPECIFIC_MAS use cases, highlighting their benefits, clarifying how they can
   help ENHANCE_LOGISTICS_NETWORK_RESILIENCE and identifying existing barriers.
   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/approach: a three_stage DELPHI_STUDY was conducted with
   18 INDUSTRY_EXPERTS. in the first round, these experts identified 11 use
   cases of MAS and their POTENTIAL_BENEFITS, as well as any barriers that
   could hinder their adoption.  in the second round, they assessed the
   identified use cases with regard to their potential to
   ENHANCE_LOGISTICS_NETWORK_RESILIENCE and improve
   ORGANIZATIONAL_PRODUCTIVITY. furthermore, they estimated the COMPLEXITY of
   MAS_IMPLEMENTATION. in the third round, the experts reassessed their
   evaluations in light of the evaluations of the other STUDY_PARTICIPANTS.
   findings: this study proposes 11 SPECIFIC_MAS use cases and illustrates
   their potential for increasing LOGISTICS_NETWORK_RESILIENCE and enhancing
   ORGANIZATIONAL_PERFORMANCE due to autonomous decision_making in
   INFORMATIONAL_PROCESSES. furthermore, this STUDY_DISCUSSES
   IMPORTANT_BARRIERS for MAS, such as lack of STANDARDIZATION,

   SUPPLY_CHAIN. through local point_to_point COMMUNICATION between

   the UTILITY_FUNCTION is maximized based on the CONSISTENCY_THEORY, and the
   OPTIMAL_PRICE and ORDER_QUANTITY are determined.  the proposed ALGORITHM is

AB LOGISTICS_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION depends on the PRECISE_SCHEDULING of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN (SC) AGENTS. COORDINATION of MANAGEMENT across all sites,
   products, and PRODUCTION_DIVISIONS is essential for EFFECTIVE_SCHEDULING.
   for multi_agent systems in HETEROGENEOUS_SCS, it is crucial to have a prior
   understanding of PRODUCTION, delivery, and connectivity.  hence, an
   innovative meta_heuristic OPTIMIZATION inspired by SPARROW_BEHAVIOR is
   introduced as multi_agent_based SCHEDULING and RESOURCE_ALLOCATION (ma_sra)
   to resolve DELIVERY_DELAYS and errors during delivery in
   LOGISTIC_SC_MANAGEMENT. allocating RESOURCES efficiently and creating
   WORKABLE_SCHEDULES in an SC with MULTIPLE_AGENTS are the primary
   SIGNIFICANT_PROBLEMS focused on in this RESEARCH. the ma_sra ALGORITHM
   provides an ACHIEVABLE_SOLUTION to the problem of optimizing
   LOGISTICS_OPERATIONS by combining PRECISE_SCHEDULING with PRODUCTION_BALANCE
   and multi_agent searchers.  if the SCHEDULING_OPERATIONS are inadequate,
   SPARSE_AGENTS are repurposed for PRODUCTION based on fitness.  this
   maintains balance and connectivity by adjusting AGENT_RATIOS. delays are
   minimized, and connectivity is maximized because no ADJUSTMENTS_NEED to be
   reversed.  the RESEARCH_FINDINGS show that the proposed
   APPROACH_IMPROVES_OPERATIONAL_EFFICIENCY and brings SIGNIFICANT_ADVANTAGES
   to the INDUSTRY in terms of enhanced allocation of RESOURCES, connectivity,

AB effective SUPPLY_CHAIN INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT is crucial for large_scale
   MANUFACTURING_INDUSTRIES such as CIVIL_AIRCRAFT and AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING
   to ensure efficient MANUFACTURING. generally, the MAIN_MANUFACTURER makes
   the ANNUAL_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT_PLAN, and contacts with SUPPLIERS when some
   material is approaching CRITICAL_INVENTORY_LEVEL according to the
   ACTUAL_PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE, which increases the difficulty of
   INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT. in RECENT_YEARS, many researchers have focused on
   using REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_METHOD to study INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT_PROBLEMS.
   CURRENT_APPROACHES were mainly designed for the SUPPLY_CHAIN with
   single_node multi_material or multi_node single_material mode, which are not
   suitable to the CIVIL_AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING SUPPLY_CHAIN with multi_node
   multi_material mode.  to deal with this problem, we formulated the problem
   as a partially OBSERVABLE_MARKOV_DECISION_PROCESS (pomdp) MODEL and proposed
   a multi_agent REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_METHOD for SUPPLY_CHAIN
   INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT, in which the dual_policy and
   INFORMATION_TRANSMISSION_MECHANISM was designed to help the

AB determining OPTIMUM_INVENTORY_REPLENISHMENT_DECISIONS are critical for
   RETAIL_BUSINESSES with UNCERTAIN_DEMAND. the problem becomes particularly
   challenging when MULTIPLE_PRODUCTS with DIFFERENT_LEAD_TIMES and
   cross_product constraints are considered.  this PAPER_ADDRESSES the
   aforementioned challenges in multi_product, multi_period
   INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT using DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (DEEP_RL). the
   proposed APPROACH_IMPROVES upon existing methods for INVENTORY_CONTROL on
   three fronts: (1) CONCURRENT_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT of a LARGE_NUMBER
   (hundreds) of products under REALISTIC_CONSTRAINTS, (2) minimal retraining
   requirements on the RL_AGENT under SYSTEM_CHANGES through the definition of
   an individual product meta_model, (3) efficient handling of multi_period
   constraints that stem from DIFFERENT_LEAD_TIMES of DIFFERENT_PRODUCTS. we
   approach the INVENTORY_PROBLEM as a SPECIAL_CLASS of
   DYNAMICAL_SYSTEM_CONTROL, and explain why the GENERIC_PROBLEM cannot be
   satisfactorily solved using CLASSICAL_OPTIMISATION_TECHNIQUES. subsequently,
   we formulate the problem in a GENERAL_FRAMEWORK that can be used for
   parallelised decision_making using off_the_shelf rl ALGORITHMS. we also
   benchmark the formulation against the THEORETICAL_OPTIMUM achieved by
   LINEAR_PROGRAMMING under the assumptions that the demands are deterministic
   and known apriori.  EXPERIMENTS on scales between 100 and 220 products show
   that the proposed rl_based approaches perform better than the
   BASELINE_HEURISTICS, and quite close to the THEORETICAL_OPTIMUM.
   furthermore, they are also able to transfer LEARNING without retraining to
   INVENTORY_CONTROL_PROBLEMS involving DIFFERENT_NUMBER of products.  2021,

AB the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the INTEGRATION of
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ia) in DECISION_SUPPORT_SYSTEMS (DSS) to solve
   problems related to the SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM). non_intelligent DSS
   approaches based on TRADITIONAL_METHODS are unable to handle
   UNSTRUCTURED_DATA, and they face GREAT_DIFFICULTIES in describing non_linear
   relationships.  looking for INTELLIGENT_SOLUTIONS that are able to overcome
   these difficulties is becoming increasingly important and has led to a
   NEW_TREND of adding INTELLIGENCE_CAPABILITY to DSS. many efforts have been
   devoted to propose INTELLIGENT_DECISION_SUPPORT_SYSTEMS for SCM. to shed
   light on the degree of AI_INTEGRATION in DSS in this context, we present a
   LITERATURE_REVIEW highlighting the following results: (a) AI_INTEGRATION in
   DSS for SCM was still in the DEVELOPMENT_STAGE, (b) multi_agent systems and
   MACHINE_LEARNING are the most used AI_TECHNIQUES and methods in DSS, and (c)
   RISK_MANAGEMENT and PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT are the most covered activities
   in INTELLIGENT_DSS.  the author(s), under EXCLUSIVE_LICENSE to

AB with RECENT_TECHNOLOGICAL_DEVELOPMENTS, the uas (unmanned AERIAL_SYSTEM) has
   been recognized for ITS value and usefulness in VARIOUS_FIELDS. prior
   researchers have utilized several DRONES in COLLABORATION to navigate to
   achieve COMMON_GOALS such as TARGET_TRACKING, RESCUE_OPERATIONS, and
   target_finding with multi_uas systems.  multi_agent
   REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS are a type of
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_TECHNOLOGY in which many AGENTS_COLLABORATE to
   perform tasks.  when a multi_uas COOPERATIVE_NAVIGATION_TECHNIQUE is
   deployed to a complicated ENVIRONMENT such as an URBAN_LOGISTICS_SYSTEM, the
   AGENTS_LEARNING_CAPACITIES become more tedious.  in this study, we present
   what is termed the improved multi_actor_attention_critic (imaac) approach, a
   modified multi_agent REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_METHOD for application to
   URBAN_AIR_MOBILITY_LOGISTIC_SERVICES. a VIRTUAL_SIMULATION_ENVIRONMENT based
   on unity is created to validate the suggested method.  in the
   VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT, the real_world situation of
   UAS_LOGISTICS_DEVELOPMENT_SERVICES is replicated.  when the findings are
   compared to those of other LANDMARK_REINFORCEMENT_ALGORITHMS, IMAAC_SHOWS a

   and speeds up the decision_making PROCESS of the seller.  the developed
   method includes determining the characteristics of PRODUCT_SUPPLIERS,
   creating a PROTOCOL for INTERACTION between the seller and SUPPLIERS,
   developing methods for FORMING requirements for SUPPLIERS, analyzing the
   characteristics of SUPPLIERS and evaluating SUPPLIERS based on the results
   of their work.  the proposed METAHEURISTIC_METHOD for assigning orders to
   PRODUCT_SUPPLIERS is based on a GENETIC_ALGORITHM and, through the use of
   DYNAMIC_PARAMETERS, improves the ACCURACY and speed of the method and
   ensures ITS convergence.  prospects for further RESEARCH include studying

AB the world is characterized by volatility, UNCERTAINTY, COMPLEXITY, and
   ambiguity (vuca). in such an ENVIRONMENT, the VIABILITY in terms of
   DIGITALIZATION, RESILIENCE, and SUSTAINABILITY_CAPABILITIES has gained
   WORLDWIDE_ATTENTION in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. therefore, it is crucial to
   give SPECIAL_CONSIDERATION to these paradigms when selecting SUPPLIERS.
   moreover, the availability of data in digital SUPPLY_CHAIN systems can aid
   in SUPPLIER_SELECTION by using ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_TECHNIQUES to
   identify VIABLE_SUPPLIERS. this approach can streamline the
   SUPPLIER_SELECTION_PROCESS and LEAD to more efficient and effective
   MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. thus, it is necessary to have a
   BIG_DATA_ANALYTICS_INFRASTRUCTURE in todays data_driven world.  in this
   context, this PAPER_AIMS to DESIGN a multi_agent SYSTEM that belongs to the
   THEORY of distributed ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE based on BIG_DATA_ANALYTICS to
   give a STRONG_TOOL for finding the best VIABLE_SUPPLIERS based on a thorough
   and data_driven EVALUATION. to do so, designing a multi_agent_based
   BIG_DATA_ANALYTICS_SYSTEM_MODEL_NECESSITATES identifying the
   MULTIPLE_CRITERIA needed for selecting VIABLE_SUPPLIERS in real_time
   decision_making.  to this end, through a LITERATURE_REVIEW, this
   PAPER_ANALYZES more than 140 publications and identifies the MAIN_CRITERIA
   needed for VIABLE_SUPPLIERS_SELECTION in the VUCA_WORLD. therefore, the
   proposed SYSTEM can be used as an INTELLIGENT_VIABLE_SUPPLIER_SELECTION that
   improves the quality of the PROCESS and controls it while considering
   DIFFERENT_CAPABILITIES. it presents a COMPREHENSIVE_MODEL for
   VIABLE_SUPPLIER_SELECTION, consisting of four MAIN_LAYERS: decision_making
   SYSTEM, DATA_RESOURCES, SUPPLIER_SELECTION, and BIG_DATA_ANALYTICS. the
   MODEL_INCORPORATES six types of AGENTS: SUPPLIERS_AGENT, RESOURCE_AGENT,
   KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT_AGENT, PILOT_AGENT, ANALYST_AGENT, and decision_making
   AGENT. the INTEGRATION of these LAYERS and AGENTS enables real_time
   data_driven decision_making, contributing to the selection of
   VIABLE_SUPPLIERS in a volatile and UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENT. the proposed
   MODEL_ENHANCES SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE in the DIGITAL_ERA, offering a
   ROBUST_TOOL for both academics and practitioners to improve the quality of

   for unification have evolved to improve INFORMATION_EXCHANGE across
   ORGANISATIONAL_UNITS and INFORMATION_SECURITY. these
   INTEGRATION_TECHNOLOGIES share and COMMUNICATE_INFORMATION using defined
   PROTOCOLS and DIFFERENT_DATA. service_oriented ARCHITECTURE (SOA) is a
   significant emerging approach that enables
   MODULAR_DESIGN_SOLUTION_CONSTRUCTION. METHODOLOGY: these designs are
   beneficial when many apps operating on DIFFERENT_ARCHITECTURES and
   NETWORKS_NEED to connect.  a well_defined STRATEGY and company_specific
   guidelines are essential for ensuring the firm'S systematic adoption of such
   an ARCHITECTURE. the CRITICAL_COMPONENTS of massoascm '(multi_agent SYSTEM
   SERVICE_ORIENTED_ARCHITECTURE SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT' are a multi_agent
   SYSTEM (MAS), a serviceoriented structure, and SUPPLIER_MANAGEMENT. the
   MASSOASCM_MODEL has been made, and a PRODUCTION_UNIT has been made to show
   how it works.  findings: it has been stated that it saves DEVELOPMENT_COSTS,
   and INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT, all of which are critical concerns in any company.
   our goal is to create an INVENTORY_CONTROL_APPROACH that relies on MAS and
   SOA but also a SIMULATION that demonstrates how it works and may enhance
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM) PRODUCTIVITY in a PRODUCTION_PLANT.
   PRACTICAL_IMPLICATIONS: the SCM_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPRISES three

AB the HIGH_NUMBER of devices with limited COMPUTATIONAL_RESOURCES as well as
   limited COMMUNICATION_RESOURCES are two characteristics of the
   INDUSTRIAL_INTERNET of things (iiot). with INDUSTRY_4.0 emerges a
   STRONG_DEMAND for DATA_PROCESSING in the edge, constrained primarily by the
   limited AVAILABLE_RESOURCES. in INDUSTRY, DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (drl)
   is increasingly used in ROBOTICS, JOB_SHOP_SCHEDULING and SUPPLY_CHAIN. in
   this work, drl is applied for INTELLIGENT_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION for
   INDUSTRIAL_EDGE_DEVICES. an OPTIMAL_USAGE of AVAILABLE_RESOURCES of the
   IIOT_DEVICES should be achieved.  due to the structure of IIOT_SYSTEMS as
   well as SECURITY_ASPECTS, multi_agent systems (MASS) are preferred for
   DECENTRALIZED decision_making.  in our study, we build a network from
   physical and virtualized REPRESENTATIVE_IIOT_DEVICES. the proposed approach
   is capable of dealing with several DYNAMIC_CHANGES of the TARGET_SYSTEM.
   three aspects are considered when evaluating the PERFORMANCE of the MASS:
   overhead due to the MASS, improvement of the RESOURCE_USAGE of the devices
   as well as latency and ERROR_RATE. in summary, the AGENTS_RESOURCE_USAGE
   with respect to TRAFFIC, computing RESOURCES and time is very low.  it was
   confirmed that the AGENTS not only achieve the desired results in training
   but also that the learned behavior is transferable to a REAL_SYSTEM.  2022

AB today'S SUPPLY_CHAINS (SC) have become vulnerable to unexpected and
   ever_intensifying DISRUPTIONS from MYRIAD_SOURCES. consequently, the concept
   of SUPPLY_CHAIN RESILIENCE (scres) has become crucial to complement the
   CONVENTIONAL_RISK_MANAGEMENT_PARADIGM, which has failed to cope with
   UNEXPECTED_SC_DISRUPTIONS resulting in SEVERE_CONSEQUENCES affecting
   SC_PERFORMANCES and making BUSINESS_CONTINUITY questionable.  advancements
   in cutting_edge technologies like ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) and their
   potential to ENHANCE_SCRES by improving CRITICAL_ANTECEDENTS across
   DIFFERENT_PHASES have attracted the attention of scholars and practitioners.
   the RESEARCH from academia and the PRACTICAL_INTEREST of the INDUSTRY have
   yielded SIGNIFICANT_PUBLICATIONS at the nexus of ai and scres during the
   last two decades.  however, the APPLICATIONS and examinations have been
   primarily conducted independently, and the EXTANT_LITERATURE is dispersed
   into RESEARCH_STREAMS despite the COMPLEX_NATURE of scres.  to bridge this
   gap, this study undertakes a SYSTEMATIC_LITERATURE_REVIEW involving 106
   peer_reviewed articles.  through curation, synthesis, and consolidation of
   up_to_date literature, the study presents a COMPREHENSIVE_OVERVIEW of
   developments spanning from 2010 to 2022. BAYESIAN_NETWORKS are the most
   TOPICAL_ONES among the 13 AI_TECHNIQUES evaluated.  concerning the
   CRITICAL_ANTECEDENTS, VISIBILITY is the first ranking to be realized by the
   techniques.  the study revealed that AI_TECHNIQUES_SUPPORT only the first 3
   phases of scres (readiness, response, and RECOVERY), and readiness is the
   most popular one, while no evidence has been found for the GROWTH_PHASE. the
   study proposed an ai_scres framework to inform RESEARCH and practice to
   holistically APPROACH_SCRES. it also provided implications for practice,
   POLICY, and THEORY as well as gaps for impactful FUTURE_RESEARCH.  2023

AB PLANNING the most EFFICIENT_ROUTES in a COOPERATIVE_MANNER is a challenge
   for many MOBILITY and LOGISTICS_SERVICE_PROVIDERS. in this paper, a
   NEW_METHODOLOGICAL_APPROACH is presented based on the multi_agent
   PATH_PLANNING (mapp) problem which is a variant of the classical multiple
   traveling SALESMEN_PROBLEM (MTSP). given a team of M_AGENTS that must visit
   N_TARGETS, the OPTIMAL_PATHS_PLAN (a set of M_PATHS) should be determined
   such that each target is visited only once.  minimizing the time of this
   COOPERATIVE_OPERATION is the OPTIMIZATION_GOAL in this study.  thus, the
   plan is optimal, if the LONGEST_PATH in the plan is the shortest possible
   (min_max problem). in order to deal with more PRACTICAL_SITUATIONS, two
   ADDITIONAL_CONSTRAINTS are applied: the MAXIMUM_NUMBER of targets each AGENT
   is allowed to visit, and the MAXIMUM_RANGE for each AGENT. accordingly, a
   so_called constrained multi_agent PATH_PLANNING (cmapp) problem is
   elaborated in this paper.  an easy to apply GENETIC_ALGORITHM (GA) is
   presented, which improves the paths using genetic_like operators and a
   HEURISTIC_METHOD. the applicability of the APPROXIMATE_SOLUTION was tested
   in four RANDOM_SCENARIOS where it showed a DECENT_PERFORMANCE. the developed
   method can be used for ROUTE_PLANNING of MOBILITY and LOGISTICS_SERVICES in
   which several destinations must be reached by a fleet of VEHICLES (e.g.,
   group ride_sharing, last_mile delivery).  2023, the author(s), under

   the OPTIMAL_INVENTORY_DECISION of dual_channel SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS when
   consumers have the behaviors of free riding, changing channels, and giving
   up buying.  and compared the SUPPLY_CHAIN operating under the two modes.  it
   is found that under the premise of the same MARKET_DEMAND, the TOTAL_PROFIT
   of a centralized dual_channel SUPPLY_CHAIN is slightly greater than that of
   a DECENTRALIZED dual_channel SUPPLY_CHAIN, ITS AVERAGE_INVENTORY_LEVEL and

AB in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT, the BULLWHIP_EFFECT leads to an increase in
   COSTS and OPPORTUNITY_LOSS_RISK, and imposes a SIGNIFICANT_BURDEN on
   COMPANY_MANAGEMENT. therefore, controlling the BULLWHIP_EFFECT in the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN is an IMPORTANT_ISSUE. the COMMON_STRATEGY and
   INFORMATION_SHARING among COMPANIES are effective in reducing the
   BULLWHIP_EFFECT. these effects have been shown in many studies.  however, in
   RECENT_YEARS, in the increasingly complex SUPPLY_CHAIN, it is very difficult
   for each company to have an accurate and TIMELY_UNDERSTANDING of the
   information that affects their actions.  this makes it difficult to
   SHARE_INFORMATION and COMMON_STRATEGIES throughout the SUPPLY_CHAIN. this
   STUDY_CONSIDERS a MODEL of COOPERATION between some COMPANIES in the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN to SHARE_INFORMATION and COMMON_STRATEGIES. studies that aim to
   reduce the BULLWHIP_EFFECT and the TOTAL_COST in the SUPPLY_CHAINS involve
   DEMAND_FORECASTING, INVENTORY_POLICY and SAFETY_STOCK_OPTIMIZATION. the
   proposed MODEL_FOCUSES on improving COMPANY_STRATEGIES by combining
   MULTIPLE_STRATEGIES and analyzes which POLICIES and actions improve the
   PERFORMANCE of the entire SUPPLY_CHAIN. in this study, a multi_stage
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL is constructed using multi_agent SIMULATION to identify
   the OPTIMAL_STRATEGY by analyzing the effect of COOPERATION between
   COMPANIES in terms of the BULLWHIP_EFFECT and the TOTAL_COST. this
   STUDY_IDENTIFIES a tendency for an the OPTIMAL_STRATEGY to be used by each

   LINEAR_ENVIRONMENTS with implementations that are MINOR_MODIFICATIONS of
   off_the_shelf rl ALGORITHMS. scaling these SIMPLISTIC_ENVIRONMENTS to a
   real_world SUPPLY_CHAIN comes with a few challenges, such as minimizing the
   COMPUTATIONAL_REQUIREMENTS of the ENVIRONMENT, specifying
   AGENT_CONFIGURATIONS that are representative of DYNAMICS at real_world
   stores and WAREHOUSES, and specifying a REWARD_FRAMEWORK that encourages
   DESIRABLE_BEHAVIOR across the whole SUPPLY_CHAIN. in this work, we present a
   SYSTEM with a custom gpu_parallelized ENVIRONMENT that consists of one
   WAREHOUSE and MULTIPLE_STORES, a NOVEL_ARCHITECTURE for agent_environment
   DYNAMICS incorporating enhanced state and ACTION_SPACES, and a shared
   REWARD_SPECIFICATION that seeks to optimize for a LARGE_RETAILERS
   SUPPLY_CHAIN needs.  each vertex in the SUPPLY_CHAIN_GRAPH is an

   placing orders from the supplier, has the SPECIAL_PROPERTY of also being
   able to CONSTRAIN_REPLENISHMENT to stores downstream, which results in it
   LEARNING an additional allocation sub_policy.  we achieve a SYSTEM that

AB in the modern SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM, large_scale TRANSPORTATION_TASKS require
   the COLLABORATIVE_WORK of MULTIPLE_VEHICLES to be completed on time.  over
   the past few decades, multi_vehicle ROUTE_PLANNING was mainly implemented by
   HEURISTIC_ALGORITHMS. however, these ALGORITHMS face the dilemma of
   LONG_COMPUTATION_TIME. in RECENT_YEARS, some machine learning_based methods
   are also proposed for VEHICLE_ROUTE_PLANNING, but the existing ALGORITHMS
   can hardly solve multi_vehicle time_sensitive problems.  to overcome this
   problem, we propose a novel multi_agent REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_MODEL, which
   optimizes the ROUTE_LENGTH and the vehicle'S arrival time simultaneously.
   the MODEL is based on the encoder_decoder framework.  the ENCODER_MINES the
   relationship between the CUSTOMER_NODES in the problem, and the
   DECODER_GENERATES the route of each vehicle iteratively.  specially, we
   DESIGN MULTIPLE_ROUTE_RECORDERS to extract the ROUTE_HISTORY_INFORMATION of
   VEHICLES and realize the COMMUNICATION between them.  in the inferring
   phase, the MODEL could immediately GENERATE_ROUTES for all VEHICLES in a
   NEW_INSTANCE. to further improve the PERFORMANCE of the MODEL, we devise a
   multi_sampling STRATEGY and obtain the BALANCE_BOUNDARY between
   COMPUTATION_TIME and PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT. in addition, we propose a
   simulation_based VEHICLE_CONFIGURATION_METHOD to select the OPTIMAL_NUMBER
   of VEHICLES in REAL_APPLICATIONS. for validation, we conduct a series of
   EXPERIMENTS on problems with DIFFERENT_CUSTOMER_AMOUNTS and
   VARIOUS_VEHICLE_NUMBERS. the results show that the proposed
   MODEL_OUTPERFORMS other TYPICAL_ALGORITHMS in both PERFORMANCE and
   CALCULATION_TIME.   2000_2011 ieee.

AB [OBJECTIVE] this STUDY_INTRODUCES the back_feeding mechanism, considers the
   BENEFIT of back feeding for PAPER_MAKING and MARKETING subjects to
   FOREST_MANAGEMENT_SUBJECTS, and explores a NEW_PATH of
   EFFECTIVE_BENEFIT_DISTRIBUTION and STABLE_SYMBIOTIC_DEVELOPMENT of a green
   SUPPLY_CHAIN for forest to the paper.[method] based on the THEORY of
   SYSTEM_DYNAMICS, the forest to the PAPER_GREEN SUPPLY_CHAIN is built as a
   COOPERATION_ALLIANCE, and the CAUSALITY_DIAGRAM is drawn, with
   RELEVANT_VARIABLES extracted, the SYSTEM_FLOW_DIAGRAM drawn, the values of
   RELEVANT_VARIABLES calculated and the VARIABLE_EQUATION designed.
   MULTIPLE_BENEFIT_FEEDBACK_PROPORTION_SCHEMES are designed, and the
   CHANGE_TREND of the overall and INDIVIDUAL_BENEFITS of the forest to the
   PAPER_GREEN SUPPLY_CHAIN are analyzed through a DYNAMIC_MODEL_SIMULATION.
   [result] under the BENEFIT_FEEDBACK_SCHEMES, the overall economic,
   ecological, and INDIVIDUAL_BENEFITS of the forest to PAPER_GREEN
   SUPPLY_CHAIN were higher than those of the non_feedback scheme.  from the
   perspective of INDIVIDUAL_BENEFITS, it is preferable to choose the fixed
   PROPORTION_I_SCHEME in which papermaking and other ENTITIES_FEED back the
   SUSTAINABLE_ELEMENTS of 10% of the SYMBIOTIC_INCOME of the
   FOREST_MANAGEMENT_ENTITIES annually, rather than the VARIABLE_I (20%, 16%,
   12%, 8%, 4%) PROPORTION_SCHEME, in which papermaking and other ENTITIES_FEED
   back the FOREST_MANAGEMENT_ENTITIES annually, and the proportion of
   back_feeding is low.  from the perspective of OVERALL_BENEFITS, the scheme
   of VARIABLE_PROPORTION_II (30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%) is preferred, where the
   proportion of back_feeding of papermaking and other entities to the
   MAIN_BODY of FOREST_MANAGEMENT_CHANGES annually, and the proportion of
   back_feeding is high.[conclusion]the back_feeding scheme is better than the
   non back_feeding scheme.  from the perspective of the OVERALL_BENEFITS of
   the green SUPPLY_CHAIN for forest to paper, the higher the proportion of
   back_feeding, the greater the BENEFIT. from the perspective of the
   INDIVIDUAL_BENEFITS of the green SUPPLY_CHAIN, when the back_feeding
   proportion is close to the scenario, the variable_proportion scheme is
   better than the fixed_proportion scheme.  from the perspective of the
   INDIVIDUAL_BENEFITS, the proportion of back_feeding should not be too high.
   while selecting a scheme, the CORE_ENTERPRISE takes the LEAD, and
   MULTIPLE_SUBJECTS participate in the discussion to select a
   SATISFACTORY_SCHEME.  2023 authors.  all rights reserved.

AB in the field of AUTOMATED_NEGOTIATION, SIGNIFICANT_ATTENTION has been paid
   to methods for LEARNING NEGOTIATION_STRATEGIES using REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING.
   however, in CONCURRENT_NEGOTIATION, where NEGOTIATION_PROCEEDS with
   MULTIPLE_COUNTERPARTIES with VARIOUS_STRATEGIES in parallel, it is difficult
   to consider the differences in the strategies of counterparties using the

   considers the STRATEGY_MODELS of the NEGOTIATION_PARTNERS in

AB multi_agent NETWORKS often face the dilemma of RESPONSIBILITY where
   optimising for INDIVIDUAL_UTILITY may result in sub_optimal network_level
   outcomes.  but, imposing constraints on INDIVIDUAL_AGENTS for obtaining
   better network_level indicators, may severely impede their utilities and
   rationale for participating in the network.  we address this problem of the
   CONFLICT between INDIVIDUAL_UTILITY and COLLECTIVE_OUTCOMES, using a
   DECENTRALISED approach called COMPUTATIONAL_TRANSCENDENCE (ct) which is
   based on MODELLING AGENTS with an ELASTIC_SENSE of self.  we discuss how
   this MODEL can be applied to realistic multi_agent APPLICATION_SCENARIOS.
   the first scenario is on decision_making in multi_agent SUPPLY_CHAINS, and
   the second is on adaptive signalling in a ROAD_NETWORK. in both these
   APPLICATIONS, we compare ct with several BASELINE_MODELS and find
   improvements across multiple application_specific metrics.  ct is shown to
   OUTPERFORM_STRATEGIES for INDIVIDUAL_UTILITY_MAXIMISATION, by improving
   network_level indicators in an EMERGENT_MANNER, without posing a HIGH_BURDEN
   of RESPONSIBILITY on INDIVIDUAL_AGENTS.  2023, the author(s), under

   PAPER_EXAMINES_VISUALIZATION_SERVICE_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES for a
   FRESH_AGRICULTURAL_PRODUCT e_tailer.  a SUPPLY_CHAIN comprised of one
   manufacturer and one self_operated e_tailer is constructed.  we first
   investigate two SERVICE_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES in the GAME_THEORY_MODEL: the
   MANUFACTURER_INVESTMENT and the e_tailer INVESTMENT. our ANALYSIS_REVEALS
   that there are two INVESTMENT_CASES in the SUPPLY_CHAIN: one member intends
   to the SERVICE_INVESTMENT (a win_win situation) and neither is willing to
   offer the service (a lose_lose dilemma). then we extend the THEORY_MODEL.
   the impacts of CONSUMER_PREFERENCE_HETEROGENEITY, DEMAND_UNCERTAINTY and
   CONSUMER_PREFERENCE for the PRODUCT_QUALITY_DIFFERENCE on the
   INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES are explored by the method of multi_agent MODELLING.
   we find that: (I) when CONSUMER_PREFERENCE_HETEROGENEITY is small, the
   e_tailer should invest in the service; (ii) if CONSUMER_PREFERENCE or
   DEMAND_UNCERTAINTY is moderate, it is difficult to reach an agreement
   between two players.  further, the GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDY_FACTOR is considered.
   the issue of how the
   GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDY_AFFECTS_SERVICE_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES is discussed.  in
   fact, it is not necessary to provide a subsidy all the time.  only when the

AB in the prospect of improving SUPPLY_CHAIN delivery PLANNING, this
   PAPER_INTRODUCES an improved VEHICLE_ROUTING MODEL using the
   ANT_COLONY_OPTIMIZATION_APPROACH. based on LITERATURE_SURVEYS, many related
   articles on vrp (VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM) MODELS proved SUITABLE_RESULTS
   exclusively in the hunt for an OPTIMAL_DELIVERY_TOUR. the use of
   ANT_COLONY_OPTIMIZATION_AID to ameliorate the SUPPLY_CHAIN_DELIVERY_PROCESS
   by finding the best SHORTEST_ROUTE_TOUR for CONSUMERS_PACKET_DELIVERY to all
   locations.  ANT_COLONY_OPTIMIZATION is an ai (ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE)
   TECHNIQUE that is based on a METAHEURISTICS_APPROACH with the MAIN_GOAL of
   effectively piloting through PLAUSIBLE_ROAD_PATH_SELECTION using multi_ant
   AGENTS and appreciably scaling down the TIME_ASPECT in the search of a fast
   and EFFICIENT_DELIVERY_TOUR_MISSION. ANT_COLONY_APPROACH enables EFFICIENCY
   for the best routing SELECTION_PROCESS and time_saving while maximizing
   profit.  for this study, a TYPICAL_SCENARIO of a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_DELIVERY_PLANNING_PROBLEM is assumed to illustrate the
   application of ANT_COLONY_OPTIMIZATION_TECHNIQUE, and an efficient routing
   PATH_SELECTION is found after the computation of the MODEL for both
   scenarios (from depart to return), and the TOTAL_DISTANCE covered is
   minimal.  furthermore, GRAPHICAL_REPRESENTATIONS will be showcased for the
   PROBLEM_SCENARIO, the THEORETICAL_ANALYSIS and MODEL_FORMULATION of
   ANT_COLONY_OPTIMIZATION are also explained, and a step_by_step
   ANT_COLONY_ALGORITHM steps wise approach are described, and also other

AB FOOD_WASTE is an alarming issue pertaining to the rising GLOBAL_HUNGER,
   HUGE_ENVIRONMENTAL_FOOTPRINT, and HIGH_MONETARY_VALUE. in developing and
   developed nations, it occurs primarily due to INEFFICIENCIES_UPSTREAM and
   downstream of the SUPPLY_CHAIN respectively.  a COMMON_FACTOR in both
   developed and developing nations is PRODUCT_FLOW within the SUPPLY_CHAIN
   from FARMS to RETAILERS. this STUDY_AIMS to identify the ROOT_CAUSES of
   WASTE generated across the PRODUCT_FLOW of the beef SUPPLY_CHAIN from farm
   to RETAILER. a workshop involving twenty practitioners of the BEEF_INDUSTRY
   was conducted and the collected information was transcribed and coded to
   generate a CURRENT_REALITY_TREE, which assisted in identifying ROOT_CAUSES
   of WASTE in the ENTIRE_BEEF SUPPLY_CHAIN. a multi_agent
   ARCHITECTURE_FRAMEWORK spanning the ENTIRE_BEEF SUPPLY_CHAIN from farm to
   RETAILER is proposed, which is composed of AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS capable of
   bringing all segments of the BEEF_INDUSTRY on a single platform and
   collaboratively assist them in mitigating ROOT_CAUSES of WASTE. the proposed
   framework will aid the practitioners in the BEEF_INDUSTRY to reduce WASTE,
   improve their OPERATIONAL_EFFICIENCY thereby raising FOOD_SECURITY,
   ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT_WHILST curbing their CARBON_FOOTPRINT.  2021 the

AB in the RECYCLING INDUSTRY, reverse SUPPLY_CHAIN (rsc) MANAGEMENT with used
   and end_of_life product collection and REMANUFACTURING has an IMPORTANT_ROLE
   to play with respect to improving ENVIRONMENTAL_SUSTAINABILITY. such a rsc
   is generally composed of more than two HETEROGENOUS_AGENTS such that the
   existing CONTRACTS in the literature fail to coordinate it.  besides, as
   long as one of these AGENTS makes PROFIT_COMPARISONS and EXHIBITS_FAIRNESS
   concerns, it would further complicate this COORDINATION_PROBLEM. in this
   paper, we develop a biform game_based COORDINATION_MECHANISM, combining the
   non_cooperative and COOPERATIVE_GAMES, to coordinate a multi_agent rsc with
   one remanufacturer and two COMPETITION_COLLECTORS, where one of the
   collectors has DISTRIBUTIONAL_FAIRNESS concerns.  applying the
   game_theoretic and NUMERICAL_ANALYSES, we obtain the following results: (1)
   our proposed methods accomplish the COORDINATION in the sense that all the
   RSC_AGENTS are better off than in the case of the non_cooperative GAME. (2)
   we identify the conditions under which the fairness_minded collector would
   achieve FAIR_OUTCOMES in the BIFORM_GAME, as is the case for the
   non_cooperative GAME. (3) in contrast to the non_cooperative GAME case, the
   BIFORM_GAME_MECHANISM_RESOLVES the impact of FAIRNESS_CONCERNS on the
   RECYCLING channel to a CERTAIN_EXTENT, as both the COALITION_EXTERNALITIES
   and biform game_based CONTRACTS make it more compatible across all
   RSC_AGENTS. our MAIN_CONTRIBUTIONS are the adoption of NOVEL_BIFORM_GAMES
   combined with BEHAVIORAL_ECONOMICS_FACTORS to study the
   COORDINATION_CHALLENGE of multi_agent rsc with collector'S

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_COLLABORATION MANAGEMENT is a system_atic, integrated and agile
   advanced MANAGEMENT_MODE, which helps to improve the COMPETITIVENESS of
   ENTERPRISES and the entire SUPPLY_CHAIN. in order to realise the synergy of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN, the most important is to realise the DYNAMIC_SYNERGY of
   information.  here we proposed a STRATEGY to integrate SYSTEM_DYNAMICS and
   multi_agent SYSTEM MODELLING methods.  based on the STRATEGY of SUPPLY_CHAIN
   INFORMATION_SHARING and COORDINATION, a two_level aggregation HYBRID_MODEL
   was designed and established.  through the COMPUTER_SIMULATION_ANALYSIS of
   the two modes before and after INFORMATION_COLLABORATION, it is found that
   under the INFORMATION_COLLABORATION_MODE, the CHANGE_TREND of order or
   INVENTORY of SUPPLIERS and MANUFACTURERS always closely matches that of
   RETAILERS. after the implementation of SUPPLY_CHAIN
   INFORMATION_COORDINATION, ordering and INVENTORY can be reasonably planned
   and matched, and problems such as over_stocking or short_term failure to
   meet ORDER_DEMANDS caused by POOR_INFORMATION_COMMUNICATION will no longer
   occur, which can greatly reduce the BULLWHIP_EFFECT.  2022, faculty of

AB multi_agent systems (MASS) have gained a lot of interest recently, due to
   their ability to solve problems that are difficult or even impossible for an
   INDIVIDUAL_AGENT. however, an IMPORTANT_PROCEDURE that NEEDS_ATTENTION in
   designing multi_agent systems, and consequently APPLICATIONS that
   UTILIZE_MASS, is achieving a FAIR_AGREEMENT between the involved AGENTS.
   researchers try to prevent AGREEMENT_MANIPULATION by utilizing
   DECENTRALIZED_CONTROL and strategic voting.  moreover, emphasis is given to
   LOCAL_DECISION_MAKING and perception of events occurring locally.  this
   manuscript presents a novel secure decision_support ALGORITHM in a
   multi_agent SYSTEM that aims to ensure the SYSTEMS_ROBUSTNESS and
   credibility.  the proposed consensus_based MODEL can be applied to
   PRODUCTION_PLANNING and CONTROL, SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT, and PRODUCT_DESIGN
   and DEVELOPMENT. the ALGORITHM_CONSIDERS an OPEN_SYSTEM; I.e., the number of
   AGENTS present can be variable in each procedure.  while a group of AGENTS
   can make DIFFERENT_DECISIONS during a task, the ALGORITHM_CHOOSES one of
   these decisions in a way that is logical, safe, efficient, fast, and is not
   influenced by factors that might affect PRODUCTION.  2023 by the authors.

AB CALIBRATION is an ESSENTIAL_PROCESS in making an agent_based
   SIMULATOR_OPERATIONAL. in particular, the CALIBRATION for FREIGHT_DEMAND is
   challenging because of the MODEL_COMPLEXITY and the shortage of
   AVAILABLE_FREIGHT_DEMAND_DATA compared with PASSENGER_DATA. this paper
   proposes a NOVEL_CALIBRATION_METHOD that relies solely on SCREENLINE_COUNTS,
   named screenline_based two_step CALIBRATION (sltc). sltc consists of two
   parts: (1) tour_based DEMAND_ADJUSTMENT; and (2) MODEL_PARAMETER_UPDATES.
   the former generates screenline_based tours by cloning/removing instances of
   the simulated GOODS_VEHICLE_TOURS, aiming to minimize the gaps between the
   observed and the simulated SCREENLINE_COUNTS. the latter updates the
   parameters of the COMMODITY_FLOW_MODEL which GENERATES_INPUTS to
   SIMULATE_GOODS_VEHICLE_TOURS. to demonstrate the practicality of the
   proposed method, we apply it to an agent_based URBAN_FREIGHT_SIMULATOR,
   SIMMOBILITY_FREIGHT. the RESULT_SHOWS that sltc allows the simulator to
   replicate the observed SCREENLINE_COUNTS with REASONABLE_COMPUTATIONAL_COST
   for CALIBRATION.  NATIONAL_ACADEMY of sciences:

AB the WORLDWIDE_GROWTH of e_commerce has created new challenges for
   LOGISTICS_COMPANIES, such as delivering products quickly and cheaply.  this
   paper presents a HEURISTIC to solve the last_mile route creation problem
   dynamically.  the HEURISTIC is based on a multi_agent SYSTEM integrated with
   TRAJECTORY_DATA MINING techniques to EXTRACT_TERRITORIAL_PATTERNS and use
   them to solve the dynamic capacitated VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM with
   STOCHASTIC_CUSTOMERS. our SOLUTION_APPROACH is focused on a linear_time
   HEURISTIC that depends only on the WAREHOUSE_SYSTEM_CONFIGURATIONS and not
   on the TOTAL_NUMBER of packages processed, which is suitable for
   EXPRESS_DELIVERY_LOGISTICS_COMPANIES that must PROCESS a LARGE_NUMBER of
   packages per day.  we compare our proposal with BENCHMARK_ALGORITHMS from

   under DIFFERENT_SCENARIOS. results show that our SOLUTION_APPROACH is
   effective for scenarios in which routes must be set dynamically from a

AB the paper presents a DECENTRALIZED mechanism for
   MULTIPLE_CONTRACT_PARAMETERS_AGREEMENT within a group of COMPANIES that may
   act as SUPPLIERS or as consumers in the PROCESS of SUPPLY_CHAIN_FORMATION
   (scf). the SUPPLIERS and consumers are acted by AGENTS and each AGENT has an
   UTILITY_FUNCTION which provides for DIFFERENT_COMBINATIONS of values of
   CONTRACT_PARAMETERS a PARTICULAR_UTILITY_LEVEL. the AGENTS decide on
   DIFFERENT_COMBINATIONS of the values for the shared parameters during the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_CONSTRUCTION_PROCESS. CONTRACTS between the parties include
   MULTIPLE_PARAMETERS, and each is working to MAXIMIZE_UTILITY, based on the
   specified CONTRACT_PARAMETERS. the SCF_PROBLEM is transposed into a
   CLUSTER_GRAPH in which the nodes represent clusters over the AGENT'S
   UTILITY_FUNCTION variables.  AGENTS_COMMUNICATE through a
   MESSAGE_EXCHANGE_MECHANISM which provides also CONSTRAINTS_PROPAGATION from
   the underlying SUPPLIERS. the proposed MODEL_ENHANCES the CURRENT
   state_of_the_art for scf by using MULTIPLE_CONTRACT_PARAMETERS in the
   PROCESS of DECENTRALIZED scf and also provides means for dealing with

   investigates the application of PROXIMAL_POLICY_OPTIMIZATION (ppo) to
   determine dynamic ordering POLICIES within multi_echelon SUPPLY_CHAINS. the
   first comment raised by dr.  preil motivated an examination of the training
   and EVALUATION_PROCEDURES in EXPERIMENTS 2, 3, and 4. the EXPERIMENTS 2 and
   3 were reworked to address this, allowing the seed to vary for every
   training iteration, resulting in refined outcomes while there was no need of
   reworking of experiment 4. the second comment focused on the BENCHMARKING
   strategies involving the 1_1 POLICY and the order_up_to (out) POLICY,
   clarifying the distinctions between the two POLICIES and justifying the use
   of the 1_1 POLICY for BENCHMARKING in experiment 4. the implementation of
   the widely accepted out POLICY was explained, highlighting the
   MEANINGFUL_RATIONALE behind ITS use.  these DISCUSSIONS_AIM to enhance the

AB in HUMANKINDS_HISTORY, many natural and man_made DISASTERS have happened and
   will continue to happen.  in a post_disaster scenario, many processes and
   actors must be organized to provide the needed supplies to the affected
   people.  although it is similar to a SUPPLY_CHAIN, it is called
   HUMANITARIAN_LOGISTICS in a DISASTER_CONTEXT. many papers present
   CENTRALIZED_APPROACHES to organizing DIFFERENT_ASPECTS of
   HUMANITARIAN_LOGISTICS. however, a centralized approach is not always
   appropriate due to the DYNAMICS and UNCERTAINTY present in a post_disaster
   scenario.  this paper describes a distributed approach based on
   MULTIAGENT_SYSTEMS (MAS) to organize the elements of HUMANITARIAN_LOGISTICS
   in a post_disaster scenario (mas_hl). INTELLIGENT_AGENTS in the mas_hl,
   represent real_world elements, such as affected zones, DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS,
   donors, and TRUCKS. the AGENTS negotiate among themselves using a
   contract_net PROTOCOL (cnp) to organize the OPERATIONS of the elements
   represented.  due to DYNAMICS and UNCERTAINTY in a post_disaster scenario,
   the AGENTS must reorganize the OPERATIONS of the elements.  the mas_hl is
   evaluated by simulating and evaluating a CASE_STUDY focused on bottled
   WATER_DELIVERY in post_disaster scenarios, they represent when MAJOR_CHANGES
   occur.  the COMPUTATIONAL_RESULTS confirmed that the mas_hl quickly
   GENERATES_PLANS to organize the elements of HUMANITARIAN_LOGISTICS and

AB the popularity of commercial unmanned AERIAL_VEHICLES has drawn
   GREAT_ATTENTION from the e_commerce INDUSTRY due to their suitability for
   last_mile delivery.  however, the ORGANIZATION of MULTIPLE_AERIAL_VEHICLES
   efficiently for delivery within limitations and uncertainties is still a
   problem.  the MAIN_CHALLENGE of PLANNING is SCALABILITY, since the
   PLANNING_SPACE grows exponentially to the number of AGENTS, and it is not
   efficient to let human_level supervisors structure the problem for
   large_scale settings.  ALGORITHMS based on deep q_networks had
   UNPRECEDENTED_SUCCESS in solving decision_making problems.  extension of
   these ALGORITHMS to multi_agent problems is limited due to
   SCALABILITY_ISSUES. this work proposes an approach that improves the
   PERFORMANCE of deep q_networks on multi_agent delivery by DRONE_PROBLEMS by
   utilizing STATE_DECOMPOSITIONS for lowering the PROBLEM_COMPLEXITY,
   CURRICULUM_LEARNING for handling the EXPLORATION_COMPLEXITY, and
   GENETIC_ALGORITHMS for searching efficient packet_drone matching across the
   COMBINATORIAL_SOLUTION_SPACE. the PERFORMANCE of the proposed method is
   shown in a multi_agent delivery by DRONE_PROBLEM that has 10 AGENTS and
   (formula presented.) STATEACTION_PAIRS. COMPARATIVE_SIMULATION_RESULTS are

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN FINANCE (scf) makes it possible to discover and

   SUPPLY_CHAIN. a KEY_FEATURE of scf is the provision of FINANCIAL_SUPPORT
   based on a CORE_BUSINESS that extends GOOD_CREDIT to upstream and downstream
   businesses and facilitates lending without taking UNACCEPTABLE_RISKS. to
   this end, a multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) approach is proposed to automate and
   facilitate the PROCESS of selecting the best possible financing options in
   the SUPPLY_CHAIN. it must be decided whether internal or external financing
   is to be used and which INTERNAL_PLAYER offers the most favourable financing
   option.  this second decision_making problem is realized in the MAS by an

AB part of INDUSTRY_4.0 is BUILDING_COMPUTER_SYSTEMS by combining
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE with ROBOTICS. SUCH_COMPUTER_SYSTEMS play an
   IMPORTANT_ROLE in the PLANNING of CARGO_TRANSPORTATION in
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. one of the approaches to building
   SUCH_COMPUTER_SYSTEMS is the use of multi_agent systems.  the aim of the
   work is to create a METHODOLOGY for constructing PROACTIVE_AGENTS based on
   REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING to solve the problem of OPTIMAL_PLANNING of
   CARGO_TRANSPORTATION. to solve the problem of INSUFFICIENT_EFFICIENCY of
   COMPUTER_AGENTS, the existing methods of statistical and MACHINE_LEARNING
   were investigated.  to date, the most EFFICIENT_APPROACHES to creating
   PROACTIVE_AGENTS are REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_APPROACHES. the formalization of
   the functioning of PROACTIVE_AGENTS is performed.  as a part of creating a
   MODEL for the functioning of PROACTIVE_AGENTS based on
   REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING, a procedure for generating a quasi_optimal action
   plan is proposed that MODELS the PLANNING_FUNCTION of a PROACTIVE_AGENT,
   which speeds up the decision_making PROCESS. multi_agent
   REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING methods are proposed, which are close to
   RANDOM_SEARCH at the INITIAL_ITERATIONS, and close to directed search at the
   FINAL_ITERATIONS. this is ensured by the use of DYNAMIC_PARAMETERS and
   allows the increase in the LEARNING_RATE by approximately 10 times while
   maintaining the mean squared ERROR of the method.  2024 copyright for this

AB the multi_depot VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM (mdvrp) is widely used in the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN at present.  most of the existing ALGORITHMS use
   HEURISTIC_METHODS, which are slow to solve the problem and cannot guarantee
   the quality of the solution.  it is of GREAT_ACADEMIC_SIGNIFICANCE and
   APPLICATION_VALUE to study a fast and high_quality ALGORITHM to solve the
   problem.  with the goal of minimizing the TOTAL_VEHICLE routing distance, a
   multi_agent DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING MODEL is proposed.  firstly, the
   form of multi_agent REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING for the multi_depot
   VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM is defined, including state, action, reward, and
   TRANSITION_FUNCTION, so that the MODEL can be trained by multi_agent
   REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING. through the definition of NODE_NEIGHBOR and the
   masking mechanism of the mdvrp, a POLICY_NETWORK composed of multi_agent
   NETWORKS based on the ATTENTION_MECHANISM is designed.  and the
   POLICY_GRADIENT_ALGORITHM is used to train the MODEL. then, the 2_opt
   LOCAL_SEARCH STRATEGY and the sampling SEARCH_STRATEGY are used to improve
   the solution.  finally through the comparison of the SIMULATION_EXPERIMENTS
   of DIFFERENT_SCALE_PROBLEMS with other ALGORITHMS, it is verified that the
   proposed multi_agent DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING MODEL and ITS combination
   with the SEARCH_STRATEGY can obtain high_quality SOLUTIONS within a

AB to increase COMPETITION, CONTROL_PRICE, and decrease inefficiency in the

   volume.  while without the limitations, participants have DIFFERENT_VALUES
   per unit of CARBON_ALLOWANCE; therefore, some participants may be strong and
   the other week.  due to the impact of these limitations on the AUCTION, this
   PAPER_TRIES to compare the uniform and DISCRIMINATORY_PRICING in a
   CARBON_ALLOWANCE_AUCTION with and without the limitations utilizing a
   multi_agent_based MODEL consisting of the government and SUPPLY_CHAINS. the
   GOVERNMENT_DETERMINES the SUPPLY_CHAINS' INITIAL_ALLOWANCES. the
   SUPPLY_CHAINS compete in the CARBON_AUCTION_MARKET and determine their
   bidding strategies based on the q_learning ALGORITHM. then they optimize
   their tactical and OPERATIONAL_DECISIONS. they can also trade their
   CARBON_ALLOWANCES in a CARBON trading MARKET in which price is free
   determined according to CARBON SUPPLY_AND_DEMAND. results show that without
   the limitations, the CARBON_PRICE in the uniform PRICING is less than or
   equal to the DISCRIMINATORY_PRICING_METHOD. at the same time, there are no
   differences between them in the case with limitations.  overall, the
   AUCTION_REDUCES the profit of the SUPPLY_CHAINS. this NEGATIVE_EFFECT is

AB CRITICAL_PRODUCTS are essential for sustaining the well_being of people and
   ensuring the continuity of critical society_serving OPERATIONS. in the event
   of a disruption, the SUPPLY_CHAINS for these products are the most affected,
   often exhibiting HUGE_DEMAND_SURGES coupled with HIGH_WORKFORCE and SUPPLY
   scarcity and UNCERTAINTY. in the first part of the paper, we present the
   synthesis of our ACTION_RESEARCH at GEORGIA_TECH during the covid_19
   PANDEMIC on the DESIGN, implementation, OPERATION, and
   CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT of an INNOVATIVE_SYSTEM for enabling the efficient,
   seamless, and resilient SUPPLY and DISTRIBUTION of
   PERSONAL_PROTECTION_EQUIPMENT. featuring a distributed network of
   SOFTWARE_AGENTS capable of AUTONOMOUS_PREDICTION and DECISION, and incepted
   with human_centric OPERATIONS, our SYSTEM notably served researchers on
   campus throughout the PANDEMIC with no STOCKOUT_INSTANCES and negligible
   URGENT_REQUESTS from users.  in the second part of the paper, we build on
   this ACTION_RESEARCH to propose an end_to_end systemic approach for the
   DISTRIBUTION of CRITICAL_SUPPLIES combining AUTONOMOUS_OPERATIONS and
   hyperconnectivity in line with PHYSICAL_INTERNET (pi, ) concepts.  we
   notably combine the usage of smart, eco_friendly, and MODULAR_CONTAINERS to
   protect CRITICAL_PRODUCTS and ease handling; VISION_SENSORS and
   SMART_DISPENSERS to monitor and CONTROL_CONSUMPTION; and
   AUTONOMOUS_TECHNOLOGIES such as DRONES, droids, ROBOTS, and SMART_LOCKERS to
   ENABLE_EFFICIENT_TOUCHLESS_DISTRIBUTION. we explore the impact of
   OPERATIONAL_AUTONOMY on the SUPPLY_CHAIN, discuss the WIDE_APPLICABILITY of
   our SYSTEM, provide conclusions, and suggest avenues for further RESEARCH
   and SCALABILITY. copyright  2023 the authors.  this is an

   SUPPLY_NETWORK (tr) and PI_SYSTEM by using multi_agent SIMULATION_APPROACH.
   regarding to pi in particular, assuming the INITIAL_PHASE of
   PI_IMPLEMENTATION, DECENTRALIZED CONTROL_SYSTEM has been adopted in which
   each PI_PARTICIPANT_PURSUES their OWN_PROFITABILITY like tr even though
   PIS_PARTICIPANTS share the RESOURCES such as WAREHOUSES and TRUCKS in a

AB TRADE_RESTRICTIONS, the covid_19 PANDEMIC, and GEOPOLITICAL_CONFLICTS have
   significantly exposed vulnerabilities within traditional global
   SUPPLY_CHAINS. these EVENTS_UNDERSCORE the need for organisations to
   establish more resilient and flexible SUPPLY_CHAINS. to address these
   challenges, the concept of the autonomous SUPPLY_CHAIN (asc), characterised
   by predictive and self_decision_making capabilities, has recently emerged as
   a PROMISING_SOLUTION. however, RESEARCH on ascs is relatively limited, with
   no existing studies specifically focusing on their implementations.  this
   PAPER_AIMS to address this gap by presenting an implementation of asc using
   a multi_agent approach.  it presents a METHODOLOGY for the analysis and
   DESIGN of such an agent_based ASC_SYSTEM (a2sc). this paper provides a
   CONCRETE_CASE_STUDY, the AUTONOMOUS_MEAT SUPPLY_CHAIN, which showcases the
   PRACTICAL_IMPLEMENTATION of the A2SC_SYSTEM using the proposed METHODOLOGY.
   additionally, a SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE and a toolkit for developing

AB the paper proposes a LINGUISTIC_CONSTRUCTIONS_TRANSLATION_METHOD based on

   ensure the INTERACTION of SOFTWARE_AGENTS representing subjects within
   SUPPLY_CHAINS, four ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK_MODELS for the TRANSLATION of
   the LINGUISTIC_STRUCTURES were created, a criterion for evaluating the
   TRAINING_EFFECTIVENESS of the proposed MODELS was selected, and the
   parameters of the proposed MODELS were identified based on the ADAM_METHOD.
   in the created MODELS, unlike the existing TRANSLATIONAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS,
   the decoder does not have FEEDBACK from the OUTPUT_LAYER to the hidden

   decision_making EVOLUTIONARY_GAME_MODEL to examine the STABILITY of
   decision_making among the government, SUPPLIERS, and MANUFACTURERS.
   additionally, a SYSTEM_DYNAMICS_MODEL is established to analyze the
   governing DYNAMICS within the SUPPLY_CHAINS_DIGITAL decision_making PROCESS,

   this study illustrate the GOVERNMENTS_STRENGTH_THRESHOLDS exist regardless
   of ex_part penalties or the mix of rewards and punishment.  once the
   GOVERNMENTS_STRENGTH_EXCEEDS these thresholds, the
   EVOLUTIONARY_GAME_SYSTEM_UNDERGOES ABRUPT_CHANGES. SUPPLIERS and
   MANUFACTURERS who adopt DIGITAL_STRATEGIES are more affected by
   GOVERNMENT_PENALTIES than incentives.  the stronger the mix of
   GOVERNMENT_INCENTIVES and penalties, the higher the incentives for the
   supplier and the manufacturer to adopt a DIGITAL_STRATEGY, but the lower the
   incentives for the government to choose a REGULATORY_STRATEGY. low_intensity
   mixed rewards and punishments, as well as low_intensity government rewards,
   are EFFECTIVE_MECHANISMS for promoting government decision_making and
   SUPERVISION. conversely, HIGH_GOVERNMENT_PENALTIES do not

AB in RECENT_YEARS, the FREQUENT_OCCURRENCE of DISRUPTIONS has had a
   NEGATIVE_IMPACT on global SUPPLY_CHAINS. to stay competitive, ENTERPRISES
   strive to remain agile through the implementation of efficient and effective
   decision_making strategies in reaction to DISRUPTIONS. a SIGNIFICANT_EFFORT
   has been made to develop these AGILE_DISRUPTION_MITIGATION_APPROACHES,
   leveraging both centralized and distributed decision_making strategies.
   though trade_offs of centralized and DISTRIBUTED_APPROACHES have been
   analyzed in existing studies, no related work has been found on
   understanding SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE based on the NETWORK_ATTRIBUTES of
   the disrupted SUPPLY_CHAIN entities.  in this paper, we characterize
   SUPPLY_CHAINS from a capability and NETWORK_TOPOLOGICAL_PERSPECTIVE and
   investigate the use of a distributed decision_making approach based on
   classical multi_agent frameworks.  the PERFORMANCE of the
   DISTRIBUTED_FRAMEWORK is evaluated through a COMPREHENSIVE_CASE_STUDY that
   investigates the PERFORMANCE of the SUPPLY_CHAIN as a function of the
   NETWORK_STRUCTURE and AGENT_ATTRIBUTES within the network in the presence of
   a disruption.  comparison to a centralized decision_making approach
   highlights trade_offs between PERFORMANCE, COMPUTATION_TIME, and
   NETWORK_COMMUNICATION based on the decision_making STRATEGY and
   NETWORK_ARCHITECTURE. practitioners can use the outcomes of our studies to
   DESIGN_RESPONSE_STRATEGIES based on AGENT_CAPABILITIES, NETWORK_ATTRIBUTES,
   and desired SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE. note to practitioners&#x2014;this
   RESEARCH is motivated by the challenges in determining agile decision_making
   strategies that enable a SUPPLY_CHAIN_ENTERPRISE to adapt to DISRUPTIONS
   while taking into account the network_based attributes of the disrupted
   AGENT and the requirements of the SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM. existing approaches
   in the LITERATURE_FOCUS on providing one feasible decision_making STRATEGY
   based on SPECIFIC_PERFORMANCE_METRICS. this PAPER_INVESTIGATES both
   centralized and DISTRIBUTED_APPROACHES to better understand the differences
   between the RESPONSE_STRATEGIES in the case of SUPPLIER_LOSS. more
   specifically, we DESIGN a SUPPLY_CHAIN_INSTANCE and conduct a CASE_STUDY to
   evaluate the PERFORMANCE of the centralized and DISTRIBUTED_APPROACHES in
   terms of several COMMON_PERFORMANCE_METRICS used in practice.  the
   CASE_STUDY provides insights for users to select a decision_making approach
   based on the NETWORK_ATTRIBUTES and AGENT_CAPABILITIES of the SUPPLY_CHAIN.
   the impact of NETWORK_UNCERTAINTIES and RISK_ASSESSMENT are not considered
   in this work.  FUTURE_STUDIES will investigate a stochastic
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_ENVIRONMENT and HETEROGENEOUS_RISK_MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK in the
   context of agile decision_making for disrupted SUPPLY_CHAIN_ENTERPRISES.

AB in today'S SOPHISTICATED_GLOBAL_MARKETPLACE, SUPPLY_CHAINS are
   COMPLEX_NONLINEAR_SYSTEMS in the presence of DIFFERENT_TYPES of
   uncertainties, including supply_demand and DELIVERY_UNCERTAINTIES. though up
   to now, some features of these systems are studied, there are still many
   aspects of these systems which need more attention.  this necessitates more
   RESEARCH_STUDIES on these systems.  hence, in this study, we propose a
   variable_order fractional SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK. the dynamic of the SYSTEM is
   investigated using the LYAPUNOV_EXPONENT and BIFURCATION_DIAGRAM. it is
   demonstrated that a minor change in the SYSTEM'S fractional_derivative may
   dramatically affect ITS behavior.  then, distributed CONSENSUS_TRACKING of
   the multi_agent network is studied.  to this end, a CONTROL_TECHNIQUE based
   on the sliding concept and CHEBYSHEV_NEURAL_NETWORK_ESTIMATOR is offered.
   the SYSTEM'S STABILITY is demonstrated using the LYAPUNOV_STABILITY_THEOREM
   and barbalat'S lemma.  finally, through NUMERICAL_RESULTS, the proposed
   controller'S EXCELLENT_PERFORMANCE for distributed CONSENSUS_TRACKING of
   multi_agent SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK is demonstrated.   2022 the author(s).

AB given the DYNAMIC_NATURE of URBAN_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT (uft) processes, the
   involved TRANSPORT and LOGISTICS_OPERATORS face with internal and
   EXTERNAL_ISSUES that should tackle to improve last_mile levels of service
   and decrease TOTAL_COSTS while performing DELIVERY_OPERATIONS. CUSTOMERS
   (I.e., FREIGHT_RECEIVERS) perceive the level of service through the
   acceptance of their requests, while TOTAL_OPERATIONAL_COSTS are mainly
   determined by the TOTAL_TRAVEL_COSTS (I.e., distance and/or time) required
   to accomplish the CUSTOMERS' request.  in addition, the vehicle_kilometres
   travelled are related to the externalities produced.  given that the actors
   involved in the PROCESS operate in a STOCHASTIC_ENVIRONMENT (with changes
   that can occur both in terms of DEMAND  receivers' requests, and in SUPPLY
   TRAVEL_TIMES), COLLABORATION and COORDINATION among the operators could play
   a KEY_ROLE in meeting the CUSTOMERS' requests as well as in reducing both
   internal and EXTERNAL_DELIVERY_COSTS. therefore, the paper proposes an uft
   MODELLING framework that INTEGRATES_COLLABORATION and COORDINATION_PROCESSES
   among the different involved actors, and allows the benefits to be assessed.
   the MODEL has a multi_agent ARCHITECTURE based on MICROSIMULATION. in
   particular, the multi_agent ARCHITECTURE allows us to point out the
   DIFFERENT_ACTORS_RESPONSES to various internal (e.g., DELIVERY_REQUESTS) and
   external (e.g., DELIVERY_TIMES) changes occurring in the
   DAILY_DELIVERY_OPERATIONS. it consists of three LAYERS. the first one
   simulates the INTERACTIONS among actors operating collaboratively.  the
   second LAYER_MICROSIMULATES the COLLABORATIVE_PROCESSES of
   INFORMATION_MANAGEMENT. finally, a third LAYER_INTEGRATES the two
   PREVIOUS_LAYERS, facilitating a decision_making PROCESS in such a
   DYNAMIC_CONTEXT. the whole MODELLING framework is tested in a
   REAL_CASE_STUDY in which it is possible to VALIDATE_PROS and cons of working
   in a COLLABORATIVE and COORDINATIVE_ENVIRONMENT. the results show
   SIGNIFICANT_BENEFITS from actors/operators involved in the PROCESS and
   subsequently can address the POLICY/measure implementation towards a more
   sustainable and LIVEABLE_CITY.  2023 the authors

AB the paper proposes a method for creating a COMPUTER_AGENT for SUPPLY_CHAINS.
   the novelty of the RESEARCH lies in the fact that to increase the EFFICIENCY
   of the COMPUTER_AGENT, ITS functioning is based on the
   CONNECTIONIST_APPROACH instead of using the CLASSICAL_PRODUCTION and
   LOGICAL_APPROACH. to expand the range of tasks solved by AGENTS, the ARTICLE
   proposes a REACTIVE_AGENT with FEEDBACK, which makes a DECISION based on
   perception or a sequence of perceptions and a PREVIOUS_ACTION or a sequence
   of PREVIOUS_ACTIONS, as well as a REACTIVE_AGENT with an INTERNAL_STATE and
   FEEDBACK, which is an extension of the REACTIVE_AGENT with an INTERNAL_STATE
   and makes a DECISION based on perception, PREVIOUS_INTERNAL_STATE, and
   PREVIOUS_ACTION. for a REACTIVE_AGENT with an INTERNAL_STATE and FEEDBACK, a
   jordan_elman ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK was proposed, which is a combination
   of jordan and ELMAN_NEURAL_NETWORKS, and the structure of ITS MODEL was
   determined in the course of a NUMERICAL_STUDY. the EXPERIMENTS performed
   showed that when the number of hidden neurons is not less than the number of
   neurons in the INPUT_LAYER, the value of the root mean SQUARE_ERROR does not
   change significantly, and the selected network gives results with a
   MINIMUM_ERROR. methods for determining the parameters of the proposed
   jordan_elman NEURAL_NETWORK MODEL were proposed.  this made it possible to
   ENSURE_HIGH_SPEED and ACCURACY of CALCULATIONS based on the MODEL. the
   proposed method for creating an AGENT based on ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS
   can be used in VARIOUS_INTELLIGENT_COMPUTER_SYSTEMS that use multi_agent

AB in the event of a FLOOD, affected firms will
   EXPERIENCE_PRODUCTION_STOPPAGES, resulting in SUPPLY_CHAIN (SC) DISRUPTIONS
   and INDIRECT_ECONOMIC_DAMAGE to firms even outside the AFFECTED_AREA. to
   mitigate the ECONOMIC_DAMAGE, it is essential for each firm in the ENTIRE_SC
   to acquire a BEHAVIOURAL_STRATEGY in line with ITS RECOVERY_STATUS. to
   achieve OPTIMAL_BEHAVIOURAL_STRATEGIES for INDIVIDUAL_FIRMS in the
   RECOVERY_PROCESS, we present a LEARNING_FRAMEWORK using multi_agent
   SIMULATION and DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING, which considers dynamically
   changing factors such as the FLOODING depth of buildings and roads, SC,
   labour and CAPITAL. the AGENTS use REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING to make decisions
   about the dynamically CHANGING_ENVIRONMENT and establish
   OPTIMAL_ACTION_STRATEGIES during the RECOVERY_PROCESS. the MODEL is trained
   using INUNDATION_SIMULATION_DATA from the ARAKAWA_RIVER located in tokyo and

AB EMERGENCE of RESPONSIBLE_BEHAVIOR is explored in non_cooperative games
   involving AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS. rather than imposing constraints or
   EXTERNAL_REINFORCEMENTS, AGENTS are endowed with an ELASTIC_SENSE of self or
   an ELASTIC_IDENTITY that they curate based on RATIONAL_CONSIDERATIONS. this
   approach is called COMPUTATIONAL_TRANSCENDENCE (ct). we show that AGENTS
   using this MODEL make choices for COLLECTIVE_WELFARE instead of
   INDIVIDUAL_BENEFIT. first, relevance of this MODEL in
   GAME_THEORETIC_CONTEXTS like PRISONERS_DILEMMA and collusion is presented.
   next, a generic multi_agent framework for simulating dilemmas around
   RESPONSIBLE_AGENCY is also proposed.  ct implemented on this framework, is
   shown to be versatile in acting responsibly to DIFFERENT_KINDS of
   circumstancesincluding modifying their STRATEGY based on their INTERACTION
   with other AGENTS in the SYSTEM as well as interacting with adversaries that
   are RATIONAL_MAXIMIZERS, and who have a rationale to exploit
   RESPONSIBLE_BEHAVIOR from other AGENTS. ct is also shown to
   OUTPERFORM_RECIPROCITY as a STRATEGY for RESPONSIBLE_AUTONOMY. thus, we
   PRESENT_CT as a framework for building AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS which can
   intrinsically act responsibly in multi_agent systems.  the CORE_MODEL for
   COMPUTATIONAL_ETHICS presented in this paper can potentially be adapted to
   the needs of APPLICATIONS in areas like SUPPLY_CHAINS, TRAFFIC_MANAGEMENT,
   and AUTONOMOUS_VEHICLES. this paper hopes to motivate further RESEARCH on

   with COSTEFFECTIVE_INFORMATION, particularly regarding vaccination.  the
   contribution of this ARTICLE is threefold: (I) conducting a
   SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW of most of the privacypreserving apps and their PROTOCOLS
   created during pandemics, and we found that most APPS_POSE_SECURITY and
   PRIVACY_VIOLATIONS. (ii) proposing an agent_based, DECENTRALIZED

AB the BULLWHIP_EFFECT is one of the most IMPORTANT_REASONS for reducing the
   PERFORMANCE of the SUPPLY_CHAIN (SC) and imposes many COSTS on the INDUSTRY.
   VARIOUS_REASONS cause the BULLWHIP_EFFECT (bwe), the most important of which
   are IMPROPER_CLASSIFICATION of orders or PERIODIC_REVIEWS. this paper first
   proposed the STATE_SPACE_MODEL of a SUPPLY_CHAIN with a
   PERIODIC_REVIEW_POLICY. we indicated that by categorizing and TIMING_ORDERS
   periodically with the concepts of SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT, we reach a
   three_agent structure with a t_order (cycle of orders). the INTERACTION of
   the AGENTS in this MODEL has a SPANNING_TREE, so it was shown that the
   three_agent approach with t_order can efficiently send optimal
   PERIODIC_ORDERS to regulate and STABILIZE_DEMAND_FLUCTUATIONS. the AGENTS
   moved to an agreed INVENTORY_LEVEL by maintaining a CERTAIN_DISTANCE from
   their INVENTORY with other AGENTS to adjust the bwe (an example of swarming
   in multi_agent CONTROL). due to the existence of STORAGE_COSTS and the
   DEMAND_FORECASTING that the PRODUCTION_AGENT_ADOPTS as the leader, a
   prohibited level of INVENTORY, should be taken into account, and AGENTS
   should avoid these levels.  this problem was solved using the discussion of
   avoiding obstacles in multi_agent CONTROL. finally, the EFFICIENCY of the
   proposed method was probed by simulating and expressing the equivalence of
   concepts, such as position, speed, and acceleration with variables of
   INITIAL_INVENTORY, PRODUCTION, and PRODUCTION_RATE.  the author(s) under

AB the DRAMATIC_GROWTH of global e_commerce has led to a surge in DEMAND for
   efficient and cost_effective ORDER_FULFILLMENT which can increase CUSTOMERS'
   SERVICE_LEVELS and sellers' COMPETITIVENESS. however, managing
   ORDER_FULFILLMENT is challenging due to a series of
   INTERDEPENDENT_ONLINE_SEQUENTIAL decision_making problems.  to clear this
   hurdle, rather than solving the problems separately as attempted in some
   RECENT_RESEARCHES, this paper proposes a method based on multi_agent
   REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING to integratively solve the series of interconnected
   problems, encompassing order handling, packing and pickup, storage, order
   consolidation, and last_mile delivery.  in particular, we MODEL the
   integrated problem as a MARKOV_GAME, wherein a team of AGENTS_LEARNS a
   JOINT_POLICY via interacting with a SIMULATED_ENVIRONMENT. since no
   SIMULATED_ENVIRONMENT supporting the
   COMPLETE_ORDER_FULFILLMENT_PROBLEM_EXISTS, we DEVISE_ORDER_FULFILLMENT
   cooperative multi_agent REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING SCALABLE_ENVIRONMENT
   (ofcourse) in the OPENAI_GYM_STYLE, which allows reproduction and
   re_utilization to build customized APPLICATIONS. by constructing the
   FULFILLMENT_SYSTEM in ofcourse, we optimize a JOINT_POLICY that solves the
   integrated problem, facilitating sequential order_wise OPERATIONS across all
   FULFILLMENT_UNITS and minimizing the TOTAL_COST of fulfilling all orders
   within the promised time.  with ofcourse, we also demonstrate that the
   JOINT_POLICY learned by multi_agent REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING outperforms the
   combination of locally OPTIMAL_POLICIES. the SOURCE_CODE of ofcourse is

   grouped in fleets.  TASK_ALLOCATION and SCHEDULING are often managed
   centrally.  the requirements for FLEXIBILITY, ROBUSTNESS, and
   SCALABILITY_LEAD to the consideration of DECENTRALIZED MECHANISMS to react
   to UNEXPECTED_SITUATIONS. however, before being definitively adopted,
   DECENTRALIZATION must first be modelled and then simulated.  thus, we use a
   multi_agent SIMULATION to test the proposed DYNAMIC_TASK
   (re)ALLOCATION_PROCESS. a set of PROBLEMATIC_SITUATIONS for the circulation
   of autonomous INDUSTRIAL_VEHICLES in areas such as SMART_WAREHOUSES
   (obstacles, breakdowns, etc.) has been identified.  these
   PROBLEMATIC_SITUATIONS could disrupt or harm the SUCCESSFUL_COMPLETION of
   the PROCESS of dynamic (re)allocation of tasks.  we have therefore defined
   scenarios involving them in order to demonstrate through SIMULATION that the
   PROCESS remains reliable.  the SIMULATION of NEW_PROBLEMATIC_SITUATIONS also
   allows us to extend the potential of this PROCESS, which we discuss at the
   end of the ARTICLE.   2024_ios press.  all rights reserved.

AB industrial MANUFACTURING_SYSTEMS are controlled by a LARGE_NUMBER of
   COMPONENTS hierarchically organized into a so called AUTOMATION_PYRAMID.
   changes to systems dynamic and structure are difficult to manage because of
   many TECHNOLOGICAL_INTERDEPENDENCIES that might be broken during
   RECONFIGURATION. RECENT_REQUIREMENTS for FAST_ADAPTATION to CUSTOMER_DEMANDS
   and volatility of SUPPLY_CHAINS DEMAND for NEW_MODULAR
   RECONFIGURABLE_PRODUCTION_LINES. while at the MOMENT_INDUSTRY 4.0 focuses
   more on standardized INFORMATION_ACCESS and SHARING,
   FLEXIBLE_CONTROL_TECHNOLOGY is still weak.  ENCAPSULATION of
   PRODUCTION_FUNCTIONS within autonomous MANUFACTURING modules enables
   NEW_CONTROL_ARCHITECTURES and strategies.  in this work we reviewed the
   existing multi_agent systems (MASS) for PRODUCTION_PLANNING and CONTROL to
   access their applicability to the INDUSTRY_4.0 scenarios.  from a BIG_CORPUS
   of identified publications in the field of INDUSTRIAL_MAS_APPLICATIONS we
   picked only the solution_based MAS_APPROACHES that focus on
   PRODUCTION_PLANNING and CONTROL. for this paper five MAS_ARCHITECTURES were
   selected for analysis and comparison according to the specified
   CLASSIFICATION_CRITERIA. though all the analyzed architectures are
   applicable to MODULAR_PRODUCTION, non of them was implemented as a standard
   in an ACTUAL_INDUSTRIAL_ENTERPRISE. this shows that further work on maturing

AB reducing emissions caused by URBAN_FREIGHT_TRANSPORTATION is an increasingly
   IMPORTANT_POLICY_OBJECTIVE for TRANSPORTATION_PLANNERS around the world.
   new and INNOVATIVE_WAYS of DATA_COLLECTION provide NEW_POSSIBILITIES to
   analyze these issues.  in this paper we present mass_gt, a new multi_agent
   SIMULATION_SYSTEM for URBAN_GOODS_TRANSPORT. the EMPIRICAL_BASIS is provided
   by an exceptionally LARGE_DATASET of TRUCK_TRIP_TRAVEL_DIARIES for the
   NETHERLANDS that was collected from TRANSPORTATION_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEMS using
   an automated DATA_COLLECTION_INTERFACE. the dataset is very dense and
   includes information on VEHICLES, routes, and shipments carried.  the
   STRATEGIC_PART of the MODEL_SIMULATES the formation of INDIVIDUAL_SHIPMENTS
   based on LOGISTIC_PROCESSES at a STRATEGIC_LEVEL, such as sourcing,
   DISTRIBUTION_CHANNEL_CHOICE and SHIPMENT_SIZE_CHOICE. at
   TACTICAL_LEVEL_DISAGGREGATE_CHOICES are simulated for TOUR_FORMATION,
   vehicle type_ and time of DAY_CHOICE, based on observed distributions.  the
   multi_agent approach allows to implement HETEROGENEOUS_PREFERENCES and thus
   differentiated responses to NEW_POLICIES. we present an application of the
   MODEL to study the impacts of URBAN_CONSOLIDATION_CENTERS (ucc) and
   ZERO_EMISSION_ZONES. the FREIGHT_TRANSPORTATION_VOLUMES transported to these
   ucc and their impact on LOGISTIC_INDICATORS are analyzed.
   SIMULATION_RESULTS show that VEHICLE_KILOMETERS travelled within the wider
   REGION_INCREASE with the introduction of ucc, and at the same time the
   EFFICIENCY of DELIVERIES_INCREASES as well.  thus the MODEL allows to study
   trade_offs between regional and LOCAL_SYSTEMS that emerge from

AB information and COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGY (ict) and ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE
   (ai) can support the transition from TRADITIONAL_PRACTICES toward smart
   SUPPLY_CHAIN (SC) COORDINATION_SCHEMES. such a direction allows for
   integrating ORGANIZATIONAL_LEVELS of NATURAL_GAS_TRANSPORTATION_ENTERPRISES,
   comprising LOCATION, INVENTORY, and ROUTING_PROBLEM (lirp) decisions.
   SPECIFIC_WORKS have investigated the lirp of natural gas_to_product and
   ENERGY_NETWORKS. however, due to the absence of a systematic ict_assisted
   mindset, no study has been oriented from the perspective of the
   DYNAMIC_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT and geographic data_driven features of
   LAND_RESOURCES. to handle these challenges, this STUDY_INTRODUCES a
   vertically_coordinated HEURISTIC_OPTIMIZATION_FRAMEWORK, in the form of an
   autonomous multi_agent SYSTEM, for the lirp of
   GAS_TRANSMISSION_INFRASTRUCTURES as MAJOR_CARRIER_SYSTEMS to SUPPLY
   feedstock and ENERGY_DEMANDS. VARIOUS_EXTENDABLE_BEHAVIOR_CLASSES are
   programmed into the framework to support automated AGENT_SPECIALIZATIONS
   regarding PROCEDURAL_TASKS of PLANNING, TRANSIENT_INVENTORY_COORDINATION,
   routing, and SPATIAL_DATA_MANAGEMENT in the SPECIFIC_LIRP_SETTINGS.
   moreover, the study develops an ontology_driven KNOWLEDGE_SYSTEM, formally
   conceptualizing the intended application_level KNOWLEDGE according to a
   GENERAL_DOMAIN_SEMANTIC_MODEL. leveraging the KNOWLEDGE_SYSTEM, the AGENTS
   determine the NECESSARY_STEPS and suitable ready_made TOOLS to solve the
   problem collaboratively.  several INDUSTRIAL_APPLICATIONS_SHOWCASE the

   the PLATFORM_APPLICATIONS to EMERGENT_DOMAINS. additionally,
   TRANSIENT_DEMAND_FLUCTUATIONS, DYNAMIC_INVENTORY_LEVELS, and
   TOPOLOGICAL_CONSIDERATIONS heavily influence long_term PLANNING. compared to
   existing practices, the ontology_driven multi_agent framework expounds a
   more REALISTIC_VIEW of the trade_off between STRATEGIC_INVESTMENTS and
   DYNAMIC_OPERATIONAL_WELFARE in the GAS_SYSTEM. such an automated and
   PRACTICAL_METHODOLOGY, in turn, realizes ai_oriented cross_functional

AB same_day delivery (sdd) services have become increasingly popular in
   RECENT_YEARS. these have been usually modeled by PREVIOUS_STUDIES as a
   CERTAIN_CLASS of DYNAMIC_VEHICLE ROUTING_PROBLEM (dvrp) where goods must be
   delivered from a depot to a set of CUSTOMERS in the same day that the orders
   were placed.  adaptive EXACT_SOLUTION_METHODS for dvrps can become
   intractable even for SMALL_PROBLEM_INSTANCES. in this paper, the same_day
   DELIVERY_PROBLEM (sddp) is formulated as a MARKOV_DECISION_PROCESS (mdp) and
   it is solved using a parameter_sharing deep q_network, which corresponds to
   a DECENTRALISED multi_agent REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (marl) approach.  for
   this, a multi_agent grid_based SDD_ENVIRONMENT is created, consisting of
   MULTIPLE_VEHICLES, a CENTRAL_DEPOT, and DYNAMIC_ORDER_GENERATION. in
   addition, zone_specific order generation and REWARD_PROBABILITIES are
   introduced.  the PERFORMANCE of the proposed MARL_APPROACH is compared
   against a mixed_integer programming (mip) solution.  results show that the
   proposed MARL_FRAMEWORK_PERFORMS on par with mip_based POLICY when the
   number of orders is relatively low.  for PROBLEM_INSTANCES with higher
   ORDER_ARRIVAL_RATES, COMPUTATIONAL_RESULTS show that the
   MARL_APPROACH_UNDERPERFORMS_MIP by up to 30%. the PERFORMANCE_GAP between
   both methods becomes smaller when zone_specific parameters are employed.
   the gap is reduced from 30% to 3% for a 5 3 5 GRID_SCENARIO with 30 orders.
   EXECUTION_TIME_RESULTS indicate that the MARL_APPROACH is, on average, 65
   times faster than the mip_based POLICY, and therefore may be more
   advantageous for real_time CONTROL, at least for small_sized instances.

   active, online, goal_seeking, and anticipatory.  to meet these requirements,
   the characteristics of multi_agent systems (MASS) can be employed.  this
   PAPER_CONTRIBUTES to the BILATERAL_EMERGENCE of the two INDUSTRIAL_PARADIGMS
   and establishes an approach for the provision of INTELLIGENT_DIGITAL_TWINS
   (idts) within the INTERNET of DIGITAL_TWINS (IODT). initially, a
   DT_REFERENCE_MODEL aligned with already established INDUSTRY_4.0
   REFERENCE_MODELS enriched with the GOALS of INDUSTRY 5.0 is developed,
   followed by an outline of how idts can be realized with the characteristics
   of MAS. the work is substantiated by an ARCHITECTURAL_DESIGN for idts

AB modular cyber_physical PRODUCTION_SYSTEMS are an IMPORTANT_PARADIGM of
   INDUSTRY_4.0 to react flexibly to changes.  the FLEXIBILITY of those systems
   is further increased with skill_based engineering and can be used to adapt
   to CUSTOMER_REQUIREMENTS or to adapt MANUFACTURING to disturbances in
   SUPPLY_CHAINS. further potential for application of these systems can be
   found in the topic of ELECTRICAL_ENERGY SUPPLY, which is also characterized
   by fluctuations.  the relevance of energy_optimized PRODUCTION_SCHEDULES for
   MANUFACTURING_SYSTEMS in general becomes more important with the increased
   use of RENEWABLE_ENERGIES. nevertheless, it is often difficult to adapt when
   short_term energy price updates or UNFORESEEN_EVENTS occur.  to address
   these challenges with an AUTONOMOUS_APPROACH, this CONTRIBUTION_FOCUSES on
   extensive_form games to adapt energy_optimized PRODUCTION_SCHEDULES in an
   agent_based manner.  the paper presents agent_based MODELING to transform
   and monitor energy_optimized PRODUCTION_SCHEDULES into GAME_TREES to respond
   to changing ENERGY_PRICES and disturbances in PRODUCTION. the GAME is setup
   with a SCHEDULER_AGENT and ENERGY_AGENTS who are considered players.  the
   implementation of the mechanism is presented in two use cases, realizing
   DECISION_MAKING for an ENERGY_PRICE_UPDATE in a SIMULATION_EXAMPLE and for

AB the covid_19 vaccination MANAGEMENT in JAPAN has revealed many problems.
   the number of VACCINES available was clearly less than the number of people
   who wanted to be vaccinated.  initially, the SYSTEM was managed by making
   reservations with AGE_GROUP utilizing VACCINATION_COUPONS. after the second
   round of vaccinations, only appointments for VACCINATION_DATES were
   coordinated and VACCINATION_SITES were set up in SHIBUYA_WARD where the
   vaccine could be taken freely.  under a shortage of vaccine SUPPLY, the
   inability to make appointments arose from a failure to properly
   ESTIMATE_DEMAND. in addition, the vaccine expired due to
   INADEQUATE_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT, resulting in the vaccine being discarded.
   this is considered to be a SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROBLEM in which appropriate SUPPLY
   could not be provided in response to DEMAND. in response to this problem,
   this PAPER_EXAMINES whether it is possible to avoid shortage and
   STOCK_DISCARDS by a DECENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM for easy on_site
   INVENTORY_CONTROL instead of a centralized MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM in REAL_WORLD.
   based on a multi_agent MODEL, a MODEL was created to REDISTRIBUTE_INVENTORY
   to clients by predicting FUTURE_SHORTAGE based on DEMAND_FLUCTUATIONS and
   PAST_INVENTORY_LEVELS. the MODEL was constructed by adopting the

   (scs), emphasizing the importance of SC_RESILIENCE, which refers to the
   ability of scs to return to their original or more DESIRABLE_STATE following
   DISRUPTIONS. this STUDY_FOCUSES on COLLABORATION, a KEY_COMPONENT of

   incorporates a FICTITIOUS_AGENT to MANAGE_INVENTORY_TRANSSHIPMENT_DECISIONS
   between RETAILERS in a centralized manner while maintaining the
   RETAILERS_AUTONOMY in ordering.  the proposed COLLABORATIVE_STRUCTURE offers
   the following advantages from SC_RESILIENCE and OPERATIONAL_PERSPECTIVES:
   (I) it FACILITATES_DECISION_SYNCHRONIZATION for enhanced COLLABORATION among
   RETAILERS, and (ii) it allows RETAILERS to collaborate without the need for
   INFORMATION_SHARING, addressing the POTENTIAL_ISSUE of INFORMATION_SHARING

AB the option of decarbonizing URBAN_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT using battery
   ELECTRIC_VEHICLE (bev) seems promising.  however, there is currently a
   STRONG_DEBATE whether FUEL_CELL ELECTRIC_VEHICLE (fcev) might be the better
   solution.  the question arises as to how a fleet of FCEV_INFLUENCES the
   operating COST, the GREENHOUSE_GAS (ghg) emissions and PRIMARY_ENERGY_DEMAND
   in comparison to bevs and to INTERNAL_COMBUSTION_ENGINE_VEHICLE (icev). to
   investigate this, we simulate the URBAN_FOOD RETAILING as a
   REPRESENTATIVE_SHARE of URBAN_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT using a multi_agent
   TRANSPORT SIMULATION software.  SYNTHETIC_ROUTES as well as FLEET_SIZE and
   composition are determined by solving a VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM. we compute
   the operating COSTS using a TOTAL_COST of OWNERSHIP_ANALYSIS and the
   USE_PHASE_EMISSIONS as well as PRIMARY_ENERGY_DEMAND using the well to
   WHEEL_APPROACH. while a change to BEV_RESULTS in 1723% higher COSTS compared
   to icev, using fcevs leads to 2257% higher COSTS. assuming
   TODAYS_ELECTRICITY_MIX, we show a GHG_EMISSION_REDUCTION of 25% compared to
   the ICEV_BASE_CASE when using bev.  CURRENT_HYDROGEN_PRODUCTION leads to a
   GHG_REDUCTION of 33% when using fcev which however cannot be scaled to
   larger fleets.  using CURRENT_ELECTRICITY in ELECTROLYSIS will increase
   GHG_EMISSION by 60% compared to the BASE_CASE. assuming 100%
   RENEWABLE_ELECTRICITY for charging and HYDROGEN_PRODUCTION, the reduction
   from FCEVS_RISES to 73% and from bev to 92%. the PRIMARY_ENERGY_REQUIREMENT
   for bev is in all cases lower and for higher compared to the BASE_CASE. we
   conclude that while fcev have a slightly higher GHG_SAVINGS_POTENTIAL with
   CURRENT_HYDROGEN, bev are the favored TECHNOLOGY for URBAN_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT
   from an economic and ECOLOGICAL_POINT of view, considering the increasing
   shares of RENEWABLE_ENERGIES in the GRID_MIX.  2022, the author(s).

   jointly promote the PROCESS of gtis from low_end to high_end through
   INTERACTION with universities, RESEARCH_INSTITUTIONS, SUPPLY_CHAINS,
   intermediaries and consumers.  MES cooperate with MULTIPLE_GTI_SUBJECTS to
   continuously improve the GTI_LEVEL of meumac, and the subsystems of the
   GTIS_INTERACT and coordinate dynamically.  to promote the upgrade of the
   gtis under multi_agent COOPERATION, the dynamic co_evolution mechanism of

   transforms from KNOWLEDGE_CREATION to PRODUCT_PROMOTION based on the
   INNOVATION_VALUE_CHAIN. based on SYSTEM_THEORY, this PROCESS can be solved
   through five parts: input, PROCESSING, output, FEEDBACK and upgrade.  the
   structure and EVOLUTION_PATH of the gtis were analysed based on the
   INNOVATION_VALUE_CHAIN_THEORY and SYSTEM_THEORY.
   LOGISTIC_SYMBIOTIC_RESPONSE_SYSTEM is a TYPICAL_SYSTEM with
   self_organization characteristics, and the DEVELOPMENT_LAW of the gtis of
   meumac is similar with the SYMBIOTIC_SYSTEM. hence, an EVOLUTION_MODEL based
   on a LOGISTIC_MODEL was constructed to determine state and
   CONTROL_VARIABLES. the results show that the evolution of the gtis of meumac
   is the SPATIAL_ADVANCEMENT and TEMPORAL_EVOLUTION of the SYSTEM under the
   action of internal and EXTERNAL_SUBJECTS, which is ultimately manifested as
   the PROCESS of the GTI_PERFORMANCE_OUTPUT. the OPERATION_STATUS of
   GREEN_TECHNOLOGY is a KEY_FACTOR in the dynamic co_evolution of the gtis of
   meumac, which is the ORDER_PARAMETER of the SYSTEM.
   ENVIRONMENTAL_REGULATION_POLICIES (erps) have a

   MULTIPLE_CARRIERS. an ALTERNATIVE_PROPOSAL is presented, based also on
   COLLABORATION, but which does not involve either INTEGRATION into a single
   ORGANIZATION or SHARING of ITS RESOURCES. each carrier is represented as a
   VIRTUAL_ORGANIZATION of AGENTS (vo). a GLOBAL_OPTIMIZER, also a vo, oversees
   the search for deliveries that can be better delivered by another carrier
   and NEW_ROUTES are calculated based on a win_win approach.  this approach
   has the advantages of being easily CONFIGURABLE by integrating or removing
   the vo of each carrier, highly distributable using a CLOUD_INFRASTRUCTURE,
   easily scalable both for PHYSICAL_AREAS and COMPUTATIONAL_RESOURCES using
   the CLOUD_INFRASTRUCTURE in case more COMPUTATIONAL_POWER is needed.  it

AB in the INDUSTRY_4.0 era, PRODUCTION_PLANNING_PROBLEMS are very relevant to
   PRODUCTION_SYSTEMS and are ESSENTIAL_PARTS of the SUPPLY_CHAIN. broadly
   speaking, PRODUCTION_PLANNING_PROBLEMS are tackled using MODELS and
   methodologies, aiming for OPTIMAL_SOLUTIONS. this WORK_INTRODUCES_REALISM
   and STABILITY to OPTIMAL_PRODUCTION_PLANNING_STRATEGIES using a holonic,
   product_driven MANUFACTURING platform with increased FLEXIBILITY. a MODEL
   based on an ANARCHIC_HOLONIC_ARCHITECTURE and embedded INTELLIGENCE_LOGIC
   provides decision_making capacity in a PRODUCTION_LOT in the face of
   disturbances.  the proposed MODEL is validated by comparing the results
   obtained with a lot_streaming MATHEMATICAL_PROGRAMMING MODEL. results show
   that SIGNIFICANT_CHANGES in LOT_PROCESSING_TIMES (disturbances) generate
   SIGNIFICANT_CHANGES in COMPLETION_TIMES. the proposed PLATFORM_REDUCES up to

AB developments on digitalisation and AUTOMATION in TRANSPORT and LOGISTICS
   create NEW_POSSIBILITIES in the organisation of SUPPLY_CHAINS.
   NEW_TECHNOLOGIES can disrupt existing CONTROL_STRUCTURES, establish
   NEW_FORMS of CONTROL and improve the EFFICIENCY and FLEXIBILITY of
   OPERATIONS. this paper provides a framework to analyse the trade_offs and
   conditions that best apply to each CONTROL_STRUCTURE from CENTRALISED to
   DECENTRALISED. a CENTRALISED CONTROL_STRUCTURE is characterised by one party
   (CONTROL_TOWER) that collects and ANALYSES_DATA to come to
   OPTIMAL_OPERATIONAL_DECISIONS on a SYSTEM_LEVEL. in opposition, a
   DECENTRALISED CONTROL_STRUCTURE is characterised by each unit in the
   LOGISTICS_CHAIN taking INDEPENDENT_DECISIONS (self_organisation) based on
   LOCAL_INTELLIGENCE and AUTONOMY. a 2  2 CONTROL_STRUCTURE_MATRIX is created,
   with each corner defining a DIFFERENT_TYPE of LOGISTICS_CONTROL_STRUCTURE.
   the framework is then applied in two PRACTICAL_CASE_STUDIES in which
   SIMULATION_MODELS are developed to show the impact of
   DIFFERENT_LOGISTICS_CONTROL_STRUCTURES. results show the effects of

AB on_demand LOGISTICS platform has been developed rapidly to respond
   increasingly customized demands.  many platform_based ENTERPRISES are facing
   difficulties in operating that resulting in INEFFICIENT_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION,
   HIGH_COSTS and top_down centralized decision_making PROCESS so that
   unsustainable on_demand delivery is an existing challenge.  such a
   PLATFORM_SERVICE SUPPLY_CHAIN is highly influenced by fluctuating
   SUPPLY_AND_DEMAND. to solve this problem, this PAPER_INTRODUCES an
   ONLINE_DOUBLE_AUCTION for on_demand PICKUP_AND_DELIVERY in the
   METROPOLITAN_CITIES, allowing both shippers and carriers dynamically enter
   and EXIT_TRANSACTIONS. a multi_agent ENVIRONMENT is created to automate the
   real_time auctioning through cyber_physical_system technologies.  the
   proposed METHOD_AIMS at maximizing the SOCIAL_WELFARE and minimizing
   TRADE_FAILURES in the face of UNCERTAINTY of FUTURE_AGENT_TYPES or the
   information of further bids and asks.  the approach is extending the
   well_known mcafee'S single_unit method, to allocate multi_unit on_demand
   LOGISTICS_TASKS using public, private, robot_enabled DELIVERY_CAPACITIES. it
   is observed that truthful bidding is a DOMINANT_STRATEGY for each AGENT
   under this mechanism while realizing BUDGET_BALANCE and
   INDIVIDUAL_RATIONALITY. the results show that the designed AUCTION is more
   suitable to employ if supply_demand unbalance exists, compared with the
   fixed PRICING mechanism.  it suggests using more CROWDSOURCING RESOURCES
   rather than PRIVATE_CARRIERS to improve TRANSACTION_EFFICIENCY and

AB multi_agent organizational MODELING frameworks can be considered as an
   EFFICIENT_SOLUTION regarding the DISTRIBUTED_APPLICATIONS' problems such as
   TASK_BUNDLE_MECHANISMS, SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT, as well as
   AIR_TRAFFIC_CONTROL. the MAIN_OBJECTIVE of this paper is to provide a
   solution based on a SOLID_MATHEMATICAL_THEORY for the MODELING, the analysis
   and the verification of ARTIFICIAL_ORGANIZATIONS_PROPERTIES, and
   particularly those of multi_agent systems (MASS). CATEGORY_THEORY is a
   MATHEMATICAL_FORMALISM used to categorically study the logics of
   organizations in DIFFERENT_SOCIETIES. therefore, it can be projected on
   ARTIFICIAL_ORGANIZATIONS in a CATEGORICAL_WAY. our work is revolved around
   the idea of MODELING multi_agents ORGANIZATION using CATEGORY_THEORY. in
   other words, it consists on the transformation of agent_group_role (agr)
   ORGANIZATIONAL_MODEL in a CATEGORICAL_WAY in order to obtain a
   FORMAL_SEMANTICS_MODEL describing the MAS_ORGANIZATION. this FORMAL_MODEL
   allows the analysis, the verification and also the validation of the

AB the (I, r, s) POLICY is a well_known INVENTORY_REPLENISHMENT STRATEGY, where
   INVENTORY is raised to an order_up_to_level s at the end of each
   REVIEW_INTERVAL_I, if it falls below a reorder_point r.  determining the
   OPTIMAL_VALUES for these parameters by MATHEMATICAL_ANALYSIS_METHODS are
   difficult, especially in sectors with complex and uncertain PURCHASING,
   MANUFACTURING and delivering processes.  the (I, r, s) POLICY has been shown
   to result in low SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE (scp) composed of SALES_REVENUE,
   tardiness fine, MANUFACTURING COST, INVENTORY holding COST,
   RAW_MATERIAL_COST, etc.  in industries that involve highly_customised
   orders, such as AEROSPACE_INDUSTRY. in this paper, we develop a multi_agent
   SIMULATION_MODEL combined with a REINFORCEMENT learning_based
   DYNAMIC_INVENTORY_REPLENISHMENT_STRATEGY to maximise the scp.  the approach
   has been applied in an AEROSPACE MANUFACTURING CASE_STUDY. it empirically
   demonstrates that the DYNAMIC_STRATEGY_YIELDS CONSIDERABLE_IMPROVEMENTS, and

AB ANTICIPATORY_SHIPPING_USES HISTORICAL_ORDER and CUSTOMER_DATA to predict
   FUTURE_ORDERS and accordingly SHIP_PRODUCTS to the nearest
   DISTRIBUTION_CENTRES before CUSTOMERS actually place the orders.  it is a
   method to meet the increasing CUSTOMER_REQUIREMENTS on DELIVERY_SERVICE and
   simultaneously to reduce OPERATIONAL_COSTS. this paper presents a case of
   ANTICIPATORY_SHIPPING in the context of agro_food SUPPLY_CHAINS. the
   challenge in these CHAINS is the PRODUCT_PERISHABILITY that leads to
   PRODUCT_OBSOLESCENCE in the case of un_balanced SUPPLY_AND_DEMAND. this
   STUDY_INTRODUCES a data_driven approach that
   INTEGRATES_PRODUCT_QUALITY_CHARACTERISTICS in DATA_ANALYTICS to identify
   SUITABLE_PRODUCTS for ANTICIPATORY_SHIPPING at the STRATEGIC_LEVEL. it also
   proposes PROCESS_REDESIGNS concerning PRODUCTION and TRANSPORTATION at the
   OPERATIONAL_LEVEL to REALISE_ANTICIPATORY_SHIPPING. finally, using
   HISTORICAL_DATA from a DUTCH_FLORICULTURE_SUPPLIER as input for a
   multi_agent SIMULATION, the proposed approach and PROCESS_REDESIGNS are
   verified.  the SIMULATION_OUTPUT_SHOWS that ANTICIPATORY_SHIPPING could

AB EFFICIENT_OPERATION of SUPPLY_CHAIN systems by means of distributed
   MODEL_PREDICTIVE_CONTROL is studied in this work.  the MAIN_FOCUS is on the
   exploitation and SHARING of PREDICTIVE_INFORMATION on delivery and DEMAND
   throughout the SUPPLY_CHAIN. based on the availability of
   CUSTOMER_DEMAND_PREDICTIONS, which are assumed to be reliable to some
   extent, two distributed MODEL_PREDICTIVE_CONTROL_ALGORITHMS for
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_OPERATION are proposed, analyzed and investigated in
   NUMERICAL_SIMULATIONS. the MECHANISMS employed for INFORMATION_EXCHANGE
   throughout the SUPPLY_CHAIN_DIFFER in both approaches.  the first
   APPROACH_ESTABLISHES and implements the exchange of semi_accurate
   predictions, which explicitly requires predicted trajectories to only vary
   slightly from one TIME_STEP to the next.  in the second approach,
   INFORMATION_EXCHANGE is rather indirect by means of TERMINAL_CONSTRAINTS in
   the LOCAL_MPC_FORMULATIONS, explicitly relying on the stock and FLOW_NATURE
   of the OVERALL_SYSTEM. the two approaches considerably differ in terms of
   SYSTEM_SETUP, requirements and CORRESPONDING_RESULTS, and hence provide a
   FLEXIBLE_FRAMEWORK for leveraging PREDICTIVE_INFORMATION in
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM MANAGEMENT. as such, they form a basis for further
   investigations towards the ULTIMATE_GOAL of quantifying the value of
   PREDICTIVE_INFORMATION in SUPPLY_CHAIN systems.  2020 ELSEVIER_LTD

AB SUPPLY_CHAINS are COMPLEX_SYSTEMS and stochastic in nature.  nowadays,
   LOGISTICS_ORGANIZATIONS are expected to be efficient, effective, and
   responsive while respecting other objectives such as SUSTAINABILITY and
   RESILIENCE. in this work, a multi_agent MODEL is proposed for a multi_plant,
   multi_product SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK that supports an OPEN_NETWORK with
   N_NODES (PLANTS, RETAILERS, etc.). three REPLENISHMENT_POLICIES are proposed
   with DIFFERENT_CRITERIA of selection.  a multi_agent SIMULATION_TOOL was
   used to implement the proposed multi_agent MODEL. DIFFERENT_SCENARIOS and
   configurations, varying from static to dynamic, are defined and tested.  the
   first OBJECTIVE of this work is to compare the PERFORMANCE of
   PHYSICAL_INTERNET SUPPLY_CHAIN and classical SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS using
   holding and TRANSPORTATION_COSTS as KEY_PERFORMANCE_INDICATORS. the second
   goal is to assess the PERFORMANCE of DIFFERENT_REPLENISHMENT_POLICIES for
   multi_plant, multi_product PHYSICAL_INTERNET SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK.
   EXPERIMENT_RESULTS_VALIDATE the EFFICIENCY of the MODEL to assess the
   PERFORMANCE of SUPPLY_CHAIN and to optimize the REPLENISHMENT_DECISIONS.

AB this PAPER_ILLUSTRATES a 10_year RESEARCH endeavor on COLLECTIVE_LEARNING, a
   paradigm for tackling tragedy of the COMMONS_PROBLEMS in socio_technical
   systems using human_centered DISTRIBUTED_INTELLIGENCE. in contrast to
   mainstream centralized ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) allowing
   ALGORITHMIC_DISCRIMINATION and manipulative nudging, the DECENTRALIZED
   approach of COLLECTIVE_LEARNING is by_design participatory and
   value_sensitive: it aligns with PRIVACY, AUTONOMY, fairness and
   DEMOCRATIC_VALUES. engineering SUCH_VALUES in a socio_technical SYSTEM
   results in COMPUTATIONAL_CONSTRAINTS that turn collective decision_making
   into complex combinatorial np_hard problems.  these are the problems that
   COLLECTIVE_LEARNING and the EPOS_RESEARCH_PROJECT_TACKLES.
   COLLECTIVE_LEARNING finds striking applicability in energy, TRAFFIC,
   supply_chain and the self_management of SHARING economies.  this
   GRAND_APPLICABILITY and the SOCIAL_IMPACT are demonstrated in this paper
   along with a FUTURE_PERSPECTIVE of the COLLECTIVE_LEARNING_PARADIGM.   2020

AB in a project_driven SUPPLY_CHAIN, the PROJECT_SCHEDULE and material SUPPLY
   influence one another.  the effective decision_making PROCESS between the
   PROJECT_MANAGER and the SUPPLIERS can promote the FLEXIBILITY and
   COMPETITIVENESS of SUPPLY_CHAINS. however, due to their
   INCOMPATIBLE_OBJECTIVES, the SUPPLIERS are reluctant to disclose
   PRIVATE_INFORMATION. by incorporating INFORMATION_ASYMMETRY, we build a
   MODEL to describe the DECENTRALIZED decision_making PROCESS. the
   PROJECT_MANAGER does not know the LEAD_TIME and the
   PRODUCTION/TRANSPORTATION_COST of the MATERIAL_SUPPLIERS accurately.  to
   build an EFFECTIVE_ALLIANCE in the SUPPLY_CHAIN, DIFFERENT_CONTRACTS are
   considered to provide a positive or NEGATIVE_INCENTIVE for the SUPPLIERS,
   including a non_financial INCENTIVE contract with CONTINUOUS_ORDERS. then,
   we present a framework that integrates the agent_based approach and
   EVOLUTIONARY_ALGORITHM. in the framework, the AGENTS not only negotiate with
   each other to complete a solution but also jointly evaluate the SOLUTIONS
   generated by the EVOLUTIONARY_ALGORITHM. finally, an experiment is conducted
   to compare the agent_based approach and the classical nsga_ii under
   INFORMATION_SYMMETRY. the results show that the gap between the ALGORITHMS
   is acceptable, especially for a LARGE_PROJECT. the results also show that
   the non_financial INCENTIVE contract is beneficial to all the players in the

AB the CURRENT intense food production_consumption is one of the MAIN_SOURCES
   of ENVIRONMENTAL_POLLUTION and contributes to
   ANTHROPOGENIC_GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS. organic farming is a POTENTIAL_WAY
   to reduce ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACTS by excluding SYNTHETIC_PESTICIDES and
   FERTILIZERS from the PROCESS. despite ECOLOGICAL_BENEFITS, it is unlikely
   that conversion to organic can be financially viable for farmers, without
   ADDITIONAL_SUPPORT and incentives from consumers.  this STUDY_MODELS the
   interplay between CONSUMER_PREFERENCES and socio_environmental issues
   related to AGRICULTURE and FOOD_PRODUCTION. we operationalize the
   NOVEL_CONCEPT of extended agro_food SUPPLY_CHAIN and
   SIMULATE_ADAPTIVE_BEHAVIOR of farmers, FOOD_PROCESSORS, RETAILERS, and
   CUSTOMERS. not only the OPERATIONAL_FACTORS (e.g., price, quantity, and
   LEAD_TIME), but also the BEHAVIORAL_FACTORS (e.g., attitude, perceived
   CONTROL, SOCIAL_NORMS, habits, and PERSONAL_GOALS) of the FOOD_SUPPLIERS and
   consumers are considered in order to FOSTER_ORGANIC farming.  we propose an
   INTEGRATED_APPROACH combining agent_based, discrete_event, and
   SYSTEM_DYNAMICS MODELING for a case of WINE SUPPLY_CHAIN. findings
   demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed MODEL over the
   traditional sustainable SUPPLY_CHAIN MODELS in incorporating the FEEDBACK
   between consumers and producers and analyzing MANAGEMENT_SCENARIOS that can
   URGE_FARMERS to expand ORGANIC_AGRICULTURE. results further indicate that
   demand_side participation in TRANSITION_PATHWAYS towards
   SUSTAINABLE_AGRICULTURE can become a time_consuming effort if not
   accompanied by the MIDDLE_ACTORS between consumers and farmers.  in
   practice, our proposed MODEL may serve as a decision_support tool to guide
   evidence_based policymaking in the food and AGRICULTURE_SECTOR.  2020

AB RECENT_IOT_PROLIFERATION has undeniably affected the
   WAY_ORGANIZATIONAL_ACTIVITIES and BUSINESS_PROCEDURES take place within
   several IOT_DOMAINS such as SMART_MANUFACTURING, food SUPPLY_CHAIN,
   INTELLIGENT_TRANSPORTATION_SYSTEMS, MEDICAL_CARE_INFRASTRUCTURES_ETC. the
   number of the interconnected EDGE_DEVICES has dramatically increased,
   creating a HUGE_VOLUME of transferred data susceptible to leakage,
   modification or disruption, ultimately affecting the SECURITY_LEVEL,
   ROBUSTNESS and qos of the attacked IOT_ECOSYSTEM. in an attempt to prevent
   or MITIGATE_NETWORK_ABNORMALITIES while accommodating the cohesiveness among
   the involved entities, MODELING their interrelations and incorporating their
   structural, content and TEMPORAL_ATTRIBUTES, graph_based anomaly
   DETECTION_SOLUTIONS have been repeatedly adopted.  in this ARTICLE we
   propose, a multi_agent SYSTEM, with each AGENT implementing a
   GRAPH_NEURAL_NETWORK, in order to exploit the COLLABORATIVE and
   COOPERATIVE_NATURE of INTELLIGENT_AGENTS for ANOMALY_DETECTION. to this end,
   against the propagating nature of cyber_attacks such as the distributed
   denial_of_service (ddos), we propose a distributed DETECTION_SCHEME, which
   aims to monitor efficiently the ENTIRE_NETWORK_INFRASTRUCTURE. to fulfill
   this task, we consider employing monitors on ACTIVE_NETWORK_NODES such as
   IOT_DEVICES, SDN_FORWARDERS, FOG_NODES, achieving localization of
   ANOMALY_DETECTION, DISTRIBUTION of allocated RESOURCES such as the bandwidth
   and POWER_CONSUMPTION and higher ACCURACY_RESULTS. in order to facilitate
   the training, testing and EVALUATION_ACTIVITIES of the
   GRAPH_NEURAL_NETWORK_ALGORITHM, we create simulated datasets of network
   flows of various normal and ABNORMAL_DISTRIBUTIONS, out of which we extract
   ESSENTIAL_STRUCTURAL and content features to be passed to neighbouring

AB this paper describes the implementation of a mixed OPTIMIZATION_METHOD in
   multi_agent SYSTEM approach, that DETERMINES_FARMERS_MARKET (fm) locations.
   occasionally, the OPTIMIZATION_MODELS that locate facilities do not consider
   the INTERACTIONS on MEDIUM_TERM between AGENTS in the MARKET. for this
   reason, the mixed METHOD_CONSIDERS the CONSUMER_PATTERNS of buying fruits
   and vegetables (f&v) in a CERTAIN_PROBABILITY for each household from each
   seller.  this PROBABILITY was calibrated using a multi_agent SIMULATION to
   evaluate the INITIAL_SOLUTION given by the MATHEMATICAL_MODEL. fm'S LOCATION
   is a RELEVANT_TOPIC due to the fact that this type of MARKET is a
   GOOD_STRATEGY to ADDRESS_FOOD_INSECURITY in areas with a LOW_DENSITY of food
   SUPPLY. the MODEL was implemented in an area of study in the CITY of bogota,
   colombia.  the results showed a SATISFACTORY_IDENTIFICATION of sites with a

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM) is a mutant and COMPLEX_SYSTEM which
   represents a COMPETITIVE_CHALLENGE that COMPANIES are facing.  it aims to
   optimize the product, financial and INFORMATION_FLOWS, that the
   COMPANY_MANAGES with ITS SUPPLIERS, RETAILERS and CUSTOMERS. existent
   computing technologies have some faults in COMPLEX_SYSTEMS MODELING.
   nevertheless, RESEARCH_WO_RKS in multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) TECHNOLOGY have
   shown that COMPLEX_SYSTEMS can be modeled in order to GENERATE_SMART and
   EFFICIENT_SOLUTIONS. SCM is considered to be a MAS, where protagonists are
   represented by DIFFERENT_AGENTS. in addition, COOPERATION between actors in
   agent_based SCM has been proven to be an EFFECTIVE_MECHANISM for improving
   SCM_PERFORMANCE. the aim of this paper is to provide a solution for
   decision_making problems in INFORMATION_SYSTEMS used in SCM, where each
   phase in the SC has been developed as an AGENT allowing COMMUNICATION,
   COORDINATION and NEGOTIATION among the AGENTS to achieve BUSINESS_GOALS. the
   proposed MAS will be implemented using a JAVA_AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK
   (JADE) based on SPECIFIC_METHODS to ENHANCE_COLLABORATION in the SCM.  2020

AB ELECTRIFICATION is a POTENTIAL_SOLUTION for TRANSPORT_DECARBONIZATION and
   already widely available for individual and PUBLIC_TRANSPORT. however, the
   availability of electrified COMMERCIAL_VEHICLES like
   WASTE_COLLECTION_VEHICLES is still limited, despite their
   SIGNIFICANT_CONTRIBUTION to URBAN_EMISSIONS. moreover, there is a lack of
   clarity whether ELECTRIC_WASTE_COLLECTION_VEHICLES can persist in
   REAL_WORLD_CONDITIONS and which SYSTEM_DESIGN is required.  therefore, we
   introduce a multi_agent_based SIMULATION_METHODOLOGY to investigate the
   TECHNICAL_FEASIBILITY and evaluate environmental and ECONOMIC_SUSTAINABILITY
   of an electrified URBAN_WASTE_COLLECTION. we present a SYNTHETIC_MODEL for
   WASTE_COLLECTION_DEMAND on a per_link basis, using OPEN_AVAILABLE_DATA. the
   TOUR_PLANNING is solved by an open_source ALGORITHM as a capacitated
   VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM (cvrp). this GENERATES_PLAUSIBLE_TOURS which handle
   the DEMAND. the generated tours are simulated with an open_source TRANSPORT
   SIMULATION (matsim) for both the diesel and the
   ELECTRIC_WASTE_COLLECTION_VEHICLES. to compare the LIFE_CYCLE_COSTS, we
   analyze the data using TOTAL_COST of ownership (tco). ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACTS
   are evaluated based on a well_to_wheel approach.  we present a comparison of
   the two PROPULSION_TYPES for the EXEMPLARY_USE_CASE of berlin.  and we are
   able to generate a suitable PLANNING to handle
   BERLINS_WASTE_COLLECTION_DEMAND using battery ELECTRIC_VEHICLES only.  the
   TCO_CALCULATION_REVEALS that the ELECTRIFICATION_RAISES the
   TOTAL_OPERATOR_COST by 1630%, depending on the scenario and the BATTERY_SIZE
   with CONSERVATIVE_ASSUMPTIONS. furthermore, the GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS

AB over the last years, distributed CONSENSUS_TRACKING CONTROL has received a
   lot of attention due to ITS benefits, such as LOW_OPERATIONAL_COSTS,
   HIGH_RESILIENCE, FLEXIBLE_SCALABILITY, and so on.  however, CONTROL_METHODS
   that do not consider faults in actuators and CONTROL_AGENTS are impractical
   in most systems.  there is no RESEARCH in the literature investigating the
   CONSENSUS_TRACKING of SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS subject to disturbances and
   faults in CONTROL_INPUT. motivated by this, the CURRENT_RESEARCH_STUDIES the
   fault_tolerant, finite_time, and SMOOTH_CONSENSUS tracking problems for
   chaotic multi_agent SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS subject to disturbances,
   uncertainties, and faults in actuators.  the CHAOTIC_ATTRACTORS of a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK are shown, and ITS corresponding multi_agent SYSTEM is
   presented.  a NEW_CONTROL_TECHNIQUE is then proposed, which is suitable for
   distributed CONSENSUS_TRACKING of nonlinear UNCERTAIN_SYSTEMS. in the
   proposed scheme, the effects of faults in CONTROL_ACTUATORS and ROBUSTNESS
   against unknown time_varying disturbances are taken into account.  the
   proposed TECHNIQUE also uses a finite_time super_twisting ALGORITHM that
   avoids chattering in the SYSTEMS_RESPONSE and CONTROL_INPUT. lastly, the

AB PRODUCT_RECYCLING issues have gained increasing attention in many industries
   in the last decade due to a variety of reasons driven by environmental,
   governmental and ECONOMIC_FACTORS. closed_loop SUPPLY_CHAIN (clsc) MODELS
   integrate the forward and REVERSE_FLOW of products.  since the OPTIMIZATION
   of these CLSC_MODELS is known to be np_hard, COMPETITION on
   OPTIMIZATION_QUALITY in terms of SOLUTION_QUALITY and COMPUTATIONAL_TIME
   becomes one of the MAIN_FOCUSES in the literature in this area.  a typical
   six_level closed_loop SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK is examined in this paper, which
   has GREAT_COMPLEXITY due to the HIGH_LEVEL of echelons.  the proposed
   SOLUTION_USES a multi_agent and priority based approach which is embedded
   within a two_stage GENETIC_ALGORITHM (GA), decomposing the problem into (I)
   PRODUCT_FLOW, (ii) DEMAND_ALLOCATION and (iii) PRICING bidding PROCESS. to
   test and demonstrate the OPTIMIZATION_QUALITY of the proposed ALGORITHM,
   NUMERICAL_EXPERIMENTS have been carried out based on the well_known

AB the PROCESS_SYSTEM_ENGINEERING_COMMUNITY has an EXTENSIVE_KNOWLEDGE and
   skills on SUPPLY_CHAIN DESIGN: from the TIME_DIMENSION (PRODUCTION and
   FLOW_PLANNING) to the SPACE_DIMENSION (GEOGRAPHIC_POSITION of facilities).
   nevertheless, SUPPLY_CHAINS are also SOCIAL_NETWORKS where
   MULTIPLE_STAKEHOLDERS have to collaborate while they have different, and
   sometimes, diverging objectives.  for this reason, having a more
   REALISTIC_MODEL representing COLLABORATION between the VARIOUS_STAKEHOLDERS
   involved is necessary and NEW_METHODS that facilitate the DEVELOPMENT of a
   shared representation of the SYSTEM must be introduced.  we propose to
   import a PARTICIPATORY_METHOD, pardi (problematic, actors, RESOURCES,
   DYNAMICS and INTERACTIONS), from the socio_environmental SYSTEM community to
   the practices of the PROCESS_SYSTEM_ENGINEERING_COMMUNITY. based on this
   method, we develop a PARTICIPATORY_PROCESS in order to collect the
   NECESSARY_KNOWLEDGE on the SUPPLY_CHAIN and ITS context.  following this
   PARTICIPATORY_PROCESS, we then develop an agent_based MODEL as a SIMULATION
   and DECISION_MAKING_TOOL to support COLLECTIVE_SCENARIO_ANALYSES and
   collectively draw SOLUTIONS with STAKEHOLDERS. our participatory MODELING
   approach necessarily imposes a MULTI_STAKEHOLDERS_VISION (within the
   MODELING but also in the RESULT_ANALYSES) and therefore the search for a
   MODELING CONSENSUS. thus, it brings a better inclusion of SOCIAL_ASPECTS in
   PROBLEM_SOLVING which are usually poorly considered leading to
   IMPLEMENTATION_FAILURE sometimes.  by comparing our approach with the
   classic one of the PROCESS_SYSTEMS_ENGINEERING_COMMUNITY, we highlight the
   strengths and weaknesses of both and how complementary they can be.  a
   CASE_STUDY on the already existing SUPPLY_CHAIN of the CHESTNUT_WOOD in
   CEVENNES_AREA (france) illustrates the capabilities of our
   PARTICIPATORY_METHODOLOGY. it focuses on the socio_economic MODEL DESIGN of
   the first two steps (FORESTRY_ACTIVITIES to harvest) in the SUPPLY_CHAIN as
   the latter is locked because of economic and SOCIAL_ORGANISATION_ISSUES. the
   OBJECTIVE is to find the best ACTION_LEVERS to unlock the resistance that
   FOREST_PLOT_OWNERS have to remove declining wood from their land.  2021

   that focus on minimizing TEMPORARY_STORAGE are hard to find, although this
   aspect is very important.  due to ITS COMPLEXITY, especially in the
   cross_docking SYSTEM with MULTIPRODUCT_CHARACTERISTICS, MANUAL_SCHEDULING is
   almost impossible to achieve ITS GOALS. many studies used several
   techniques, such as GENETIC_ALGORITHM (GA) and mixed INTEGER_PROGRAMMING
   where these methods are computationally expensive.  based on this problem,
   in this work, we propose NEW_TRUCK_SCHEDULING_MODEL in a cross_docking
   terminal with limited TEMPORARY_STORAGE_CONSTRAINT. this MODEL is developed
   by using multi_agent SYSTEM. the MAIN_CONTRIBUTION of this work is proposing
   the multi_agent_based TRUCK_SCHEDULING_MODEL with limited
   TEMPORARY_STORAGE_CAPACITY_CONSTRAINT and TEMPORARY_TRUCK_CHANGEOVER permit.
   in it, there are three AGENTS: inbound_trucks SCHEDULER_AGENT,
   outbound_trucks SCHEDULER_AGENT, and MATERIAL_HANDLER_AGENT. the
   SHORTEST_REMAINING_TIME (srt) ALGORITHM is adopted in every AGENT. based on
   the SIMULATION_RESULT, this proposed MODEL is proven competitive compared
   with the existing fifo based MODELS and integer_programming based MODEL.
   compared with the integer_programming MODEL, it creates 41.8 percent lower
   in MAXIMUM_INVENTORY_LEVEL. compared with the fifo based MODEL, it creates
   52.1 to 55.1 percent lower in MAXIMUM_INVENTORY_LEVEL. in TOTAL_TIME_ASPECT,
   it creates 0.2 to 2.2 percent lower than the fifo based MODEL. it creates
   7.2 percent higher in TOTAL_TIME compared with the integer_programming based
   MODEL.  2021. all rights reserved.

AB REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (rl) has achieved a degree of success in
   CONTROL_APPLICATIONS such as ONLINE_GAMEPLAY and AUTONOMOUS_DRIVING, but has
   rarely been used to MANAGE_OPERATIONS of business_critical systems such as
   SUPPLY_CHAINS. a KEY_ASPECT of using rl in the REAL_WORLD is to train the
   AGENT before deployment by computing the effect of ITS EXPLORATORY_ACTIONS
   on the ENVIRONMENT. while this effect is easy to compute for ONLINE_GAMEPLAY
   (where the RULES of the GAME are well known) and AUTONOMOUS_DRIVING (where
   the DYNAMICS of the vehicle are predictable), it is much more difficult for
   COMPLEX_SYSTEMS due to associated complexities, such as UNCERTAINTY,
   ADAPTABILITY and EMERGENT_BEHAVIOUR. in this paper, we describe a framework
   for EFFECTIVE_INTEGRATION of a REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_CONTROLLER with an
   actor_based multi_agent SIMULATION of the SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK including the
   WAREHOUSE, TRANSPORTATION_SYSTEM, and stores, with the OBJECTIVE of
   maximizing PRODUCT_AVAILABILITY while minimising wastage under constraints.

AB the RAPID_ADVANCEMENT of technologies leading to AUTOMATION 5.0 has
   challenged MANUFACTURERS preparing for factories of the future, including
   WAREHOUSES, which are considered a KEY_ELEMENT in SUPPLY_CHAINS. because of
   technologies such as WAREHOUSE_ROBOTS, INTERNET_OF_THINGS, INTERNET of
   services, and cyber_augmented COLLABORATION, the
   TRADITIONAL_WAREHOUSE_SYSTEM_STRUCTURE has been changed, improving ITS
   performances significantly.  the challenges, however, are how to DESIGN a
   SYSTEM with multi_agents and technologies to reach MAXIMUM_POTENTIAL. in
   this study, a NEW_COLLABORATIVE_WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL for
   CYBER_COLLABORATIVE_WAREHOUSE, called
   COLLABORATION_REQUIREMENT_PLANNING_PROTOCOL for hub_ci (crp_h), is developed
   for optimising the COLLABORATIVE_WORKFLOW of a WAREHOUSE multi_agent SYSTEM.
   the two phases of crp_h are designed to answer questions: (1) which robot(s)
   should execute which task?  and (2) when should this task be executed?
   results show (with STATISTICAL_SIGNIFICANCE) that under crp_h,
   TOTAL_OPERATIONAL_COST_REDUCES by 11.84%, and total weighted
   COMPLETION_TIME_REDUCES by 37.11%. when the SYSTEM has unplanned requests,
   crp_h can still reduce TOTAL_OPERATIONAL_COST by 5.70% and total weighted
   COMPLETION_TIME by 10.11%. lastly, crp_h, which enables a HUMAN_INPUT
   integrated into the DESIGN, can also reduce the TOTAL_OPERATIONAL_COST even
   when CRITICAL_INFORMATION is missing.  2021 INFORMA_UK limited, trading as

AB MANUFACTURING COMPANIES typically use
   SOPHISTICATED_PRODUCTION_PLANNING_SYSTEMS optimizing PRODUCTION_STEPS, often
   delivering near_optimal SOLUTIONS. as a downside for delivering a
   near_optimal SCHEDULE, PLANNING systems have HIGH_COMPUTATIONAL_DEMANDS
   resulting in hours of computation.  under NORMAL_CIRCUMSTANCES this is not
   issue if there is enough BUFFER_TIME before implementation of the SCHEDULE
   (e.g.  at night for the next day). however, in case of
   UNEXPECTED_DISRUPTIONS such as delayed PART_DELIVERIES or defectively
   manufactured goods, the planned SCHEDULE may become invalid and swift
   replanning becomes necessary.  such immediate replanning is unsuited for
   existing OPTIMAL_PLANNERS due to the COMPUTATIONAL_REQUIREMENTS. this paper
   proposes a NOVEL_SOLUTION that can effectively and efficiently perform
   replanning in case of DIFFERENT_TYPES of DISRUPTIONS using an existing plan.
   the approach is based on the idea to adhere to the existing SCHEDULE as much
   as possible, adapting it based on limited LOCAL_CHANGES. for that purpose an
   agent_based SCHEDULING_MECHANISM has been devised, in which AGENTS represent
   materials and PRODUCTION_SITES and use LOCAL_OPTIMIZATION_TECHNIQUES and
   negotiations to generate an adapted (sufficient, but non_optimal) SCHEDULE.
   the approach has been evaluated using real PRODUCTION_DATA from huawei,
   showing that EFFICIENT_SCHEDULES are produced in SHORT_TIME. the SYSTEM has
   been implemented as PROOF_OF_CONCEPT and is currently reimplemented and
   transferred to a PRODUCTION_SYSTEM based on the JADEX_AGENT_PLATFORM.   2020

AB FACILITY_LAYOUT_PROBLEM (flp) has a GREAT_IMPACT on the EFFICIENCY of any
   ORGANIZATION. it is concerned with defining the OPTIMAL_LOCATION for each
   facility in order to optimize the SUPPLY_CHAIN_PRODUCTIVITY. in this kind of
   problems, the choice of RESOLUTION_APPROACH depends on the COMPLEXITY and
   the size of the problem.  operating THEATERS are generally BIG_STRUCTURES
   containing a lot of facilities, which makes the conception of their layout a
   COMPLEX_PROBLEM. in the literature, EXACT_METHODS are powerless when faced
   with PROBLEM_SIZES up to 18 facilities.  this leads us to explore other
   approaches, looking for EFFICIENT_SOLUTIONS. this paper presents a
   NOVEL_APPROACH using a multi_agents SYSTEM where AGENTS' skills are
   exploited to cover a WIDE_RESEARCH_SPACE, to accelerate the decision_making
   PROCESS and to deal with real_life PROBLEM_SIZES. this decision_making tool
   is based on several mixed INTEGER_LINEAR programming MODELS for solving the
   flp, and considers two types of environments with deterministic and
   VARIANT_PATIENT_DEMAND. several EXPERIMENTS have been performed to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and several PROBLEM_INSTANCES

AB the need for self_adaptive and INTELLIGENT SUPPLY_CHAIN systems is essential
   to meet the challenges of the CURRENT_GLOBAL_MARKETS. despite the
   RECENT_BREAKTHROUGHS in ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE, literature still lacks the
   application of state_of_the_art methods to optimize the PERFORMANCE of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN ordering MANAGEMENT_PROBLEMS. thus, this paper proposes a
   relatively NEW_DEEP_REINFORCEMENT learning_based ORDERING_MECHANISM (drlom)
   for multi_echelon linear SUPPLY_CHAIN systems.  initially, the SUPPLY_CHAIN
   ordering MANAGEMENT_PROBLEM is formulated as an agent_based
   REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_MODEL and, afterwards, solved using a recently
   developed policy_based ALGORITHM called PROXIMAL_POLICY_OPTIMIZATION. the
   proposed approach (drlom) aids the assumed SUPPLY_CHAIN echelons, such as
   the RETAILER, the wholesaler, the distributor and the factory, to learn the
   optimal/near_optimal DYNAMIC_STRATEGIES for INVENTORY ordering systems.  the
   EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS also validate that the proposed approach efficiently
   minimizes the system_wide total accumulated INVENTORY_COSTS under
   DIFFERENT_PROBLEM_INSTANCES than other ordering HEURISTICS and
   EVOLUTIONARY_COMPUTATION_METHODS. throughout this paper, BENCHMARK_FINDINGS
   from the literature are used to evaluate the PERFORMANCE of the proposed
   approach.  furthermore, limitations of the earlier works are addressed

AB this RESEARCH_AIMS to prompt AGENTS to improve their strategies initiatively
   in order to decrease CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS and ENHANCE_GREEN_FACTORS
   during PRODUCTION and CONSUMPTION_PROCESSES. an
   INCENTIVE_NEGOTIATION_MECHANISM is proposed for AGENTS in SUPPLY_CHAINS to
   improve their strategies.  MULTIPLE_ITEMS, MULTIPLE_ATTRIBUTES, and
   MULTIPLE_ECHELONS are involved in the proposed MODEL. in addition, this
   RESEARCH takes both the COMMERCE and the ENVIRONMENTAL_ATTRIBUTES into
   account.  the ENVIRONMENTAL_ATTRIBUTES were transformed into rewards or
   penalty by setting REWARD_FACTORS or PENALTY_FACTORS, and were taken into
   account during the calculation of the profits.  the SIMULATION_RESULTS show
   that the proposed MODEL was feasible to solve the
   COMPLEX_NEGOTIATION_PROBLEMS, and had a GOOD_PERFORMANCE. the GREEN_FACTORS
   of AGENTS in the green SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK are increased when the AGENTS
   have LOW_INITIAL_GREEN_FACTORS. moreover, the proposed MODEL can effectively
   reduce the CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS as well.  the proposed MODEL can be seen
   as a WINWIN_SOLUTION from the perspective of both business and
   ENVIRONMENTAL_PROTECTION. the TOTAL_PROFIT of the green SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK
   is improved, and the harm to the ENVIRONMENT is decreased as well.  the

AB as one of the most prevailing RETAIL_CHANNELS, e_commerce has nowadays
   facilitated RETAILERS to sell goods to CUSTOMERS_WORLDWIDE and tremendously
   increased the SUPPLY_CHAIN_EFFICIENCY by removing most INTERMEDIATE_LINKS.
   the broaden BUSINESS_SCOPE and accelerated GOODS_CIRCULATION, nevertheless,
   have generally led to CAPITAL_SHORTAGES for RETAILERS, especially small and
   MEDIUM_ENTERPRISES (SMES). given the SMES_DIFFICULTY in acquiring CAPITAL
   from FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS such as banks, LOGISTICS_FINANCE (lf) has
   emerged as an alternative, which is the combination of LOGISTICS and
   FINANCIAL_SERVICE. however, the FREQUENT_ORDER_FULFILLMENT and diversity of
   pledges in e_commerce hinder SMES in meeting lf'S financing requirements.
   furthermore, the CURRENT_LF_RELIES more on large and reputable third_party
   LOGISTICS (3pls) to alleviate financing RISKS, which in TURN_RAISES the
   ENTRY_THRESHOLD for other 3pls.  hence, this paper has proposed a
   blockchain_enabled LOGISTICS_FINANCE EXECUTION_PLATFORM (bclfep) as an
   integrated solution to FACILITATE_LF for e_commerce retail.  a cross_layered
   ARCHITECTURE is proposed to organize and manage involved RESOURCES,
   workflows and decisions based on the object_oriented METHODOLOGY (oom). a
   HYBRID_FINITE_STATE machine_based SMART_CONTRACT (hfsm_sc) is designed to
   associate and coordinate with all kinds of AGENTS for LF_OPERATIONS
   throughout ITS lifecycle.  moreover, BLOCKCHAIN is integrated with
   AGENT_TECHNOLOGY to construct a blockchain_enabled multi_agent SYSTEM
   (bcmas), providing a trusted RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT to more autonomously and
   efficiently execute SMART_CONTRACT. finally, a CASE_STUDY is conducted to

   for new and EFFICIENT_PROCESS for SUPPLY_CHAIN has become necessarily
   important.  to this end, SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT among MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM is
   proposed for addressing the selection and EVALUATION_PROCESS related to the
   INBOUND_LOGISTICS. however, most of RECENT_SYSTEMS deal solely with the
   NEGOTIATION including the selection of one or MULTIPLE_SUPPLIERS, without
   supporting the TRANSPORTATION_PROVIDER_SELECTION simultaneously and consider
   it as DECISION_CRITERION that affect the FINAL_CHOICE of
   COOPERATIVE_SUPPLIERS. as part of win_win NEGOTIATION,
   ACTIVE_SUPPLIER_INVOLVEMENT can ENHANCE_EFFICIENCY and effectiveness of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. then again, TRANSPORT_COST_CONSTITUTES the most
   IMPORTANT_FACTOR in the third of the TOTAL_OPERATIONAL_COSTS of a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. to face this challenge, a NEW_FORM of SUPPLIER_SELECTION
   including TRANSPORTATION_PROVIDER_SELECTION is proposed.  for this purpose,
   we present a multi_issue DECISION PROTOCOL based on ONTOLOGY to support the
   NEGOTIATION between UPSTREAM_NODES of SUPPLY_CHAIN in the proposed
   MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM. furthermore, the automated multi_criteria ANALYSIS_MODEL
   based on combined ANALYTICAL_HIERARCHY_PROCESS (AHP) and TOPSIS is judged

AB in INDUSTRY_4.0, a network of ENTERPRISES and facto_ries is constructed
   collaboratively and dynamically according to the cyber PHYSICAL_SYSTEM (cps)
   paradigm.  it is necessary to build smart SUPPLY_CHAINS according to this
   concept.  a network of COMPONENT_ENTERPRISES in a SUPPLY_CHAIN would be
   modeled as a virtual SUPPLY_CHAIN in the CYBER_WORLD. from the viewpoint of
   INDUSTRY_4.0, virtualizing a SUPPLY_CHAIN is the foundation for constructing
   a cps for a SUPPLY_CHAIN. the virtualization of a SUPPLY_CHAIN makes it
   easier for COMPANIES to study their integrating and expanding opportunities.
   by using this cps, comprehensive and AUTONOMOUS_OPTIMIZATION of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN can be achieved.  this virtual SUPPLY_CHAIN can be used to
   sim_ulate the PLANNING_PHASE with NEGOTIATION, as well as the
   PRODUCTION_PHASE. in this paper, instead of SPECIFIC_MATHEMATICAL MODELING
   for each SUPPLY_CHAIN, a gen_eral CONFIGURATION_METHOD of a virtual
   SUPPLY_CHAIN is proposed.  the CONFIGURATION_METHOD of a SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL
   is proposed as a virtual SUPPLY_CHAIN using ENTERPRISE e_catalogues.  a
   virtual SUPPLY_CHAIN is constructed as a multi_agent SYSTEM, which is
   connections of SOFTWARE_AGENTS that are automatically created from each
   selected ENTERPRISE_MODEL in the e_catalogues.  three types of
   COMPONENT_ENTERPRISE_MODELS are pro_vided: MANUFACTURER_MODEL, part/material
   SUPPLIER_MODEL, and RETAILER_MODEL. MODELING templates for these three types
   of ENTERPRISES are prepared, and each template is a NOMINAL_MODEL in terms
   of ENTERPRISES_BEHAVIOR. specific component_enterprise MODELS are prepared
   by filling the APPROPRIATE_TEMPLATE. each COMPONENT_ENTERPRISE_AGENT is
   implemented using the ENTERPRISE_MODEL selected from the catalogues.
   manu_facturer, RETAILER, and supplier e_catalogues, as well as an
   AUTOMATIC_CONSTRUCTION_SYSTEM of a virtual SUPPLY_CHAIN, are implemented.

   potential for ENTERPRISES to improve their ability to adapt to
   MARKET_CHANGES and improve their COMPETITIVENESS will become smaller and
   smaller, and the difficulty will increase, such as PRODUCT_DELIVERY_SPEED,
   quality, COST and service.  the level will obviously be constrained by the
   relationship between PRODUCT_MANUFACTURERS and SUPPLIERS of RAW_MATERIALS
   and COMPONENTS, PRODUCT_DISTRIBUTORS, etc.  more and more ENTERPRISES are

   increasingly IMPORTANT_ROLE in the PROCESS of ENTERPRISE_COMPETITION.
   high_level SUPPLY_CHAIN_OPERATION and MANAGEMENT are the key to
   SUCCESSFUL_OPERATION of the company.  the SUPPLY_CHAIN is a COMPLEX_SYSTEM,
   which requires members to reduce the BULLWHIP_EFFECT through
   INFORMATION_SHARING, to achieve DECISION_SYNCHRONIZATION, reduce INVENTORY,
   and improve MARKET_RESPONSE. therefore, INFORMATION_SHARING is an
   IMPORTANT_PART of SUPPLY_CHAIN RESEARCH. the COMPETITION in the century is
   the COMPETITION between SUPPLY_CHAINS. the end_customers individualization
   of products, the increasing requirements for diversification, and the
   increasing UNCERTAINTY of the ECONOMIC_ENVIRONMENT have prompted ENTERPRISES
   to pay more and more attention to the COORDINATION of relations among
   members of the SUPPLY_CHAIN. the key to coordinate the SUPPLY_CHAIN is to
   realize INFORMATION_SHARING. this paper proposes an ARCHITECTURE of agile
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM based on the multi_agent INFORMATION_SHARING
   under the guidance of self_organization THEORY. at the same time, the

AB we focus on the application of MULTIAGENT_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING for
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. the BEER_GAME is an example of a problem in
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT and has been studied as a COOPERATION_PROBLEM in
   MULTIAGENT_SYSTEMS. in the PREVIOUS_STUDY, a METHOD_SRDQN that is based on
   DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING and REWARD_SHAPING has been applied as a
   solution to the BEER_GAME. in the PREVIOUS_STUDY of srdqn, a single AGENT in
   a GAME_PERFORMS_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING considering other AGENTS to reduce
   the GLOBAL_COST for inventories of beers.  however, it is possible to employ
   other REWARD_SHAPING techniques to improve LEARNING_STABILITY. it can also
   be effective in the systems consisting of MULTIPLE_AGENTS that perform
   REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING. we apply a REWARD_SHAPING TECHNIQUE based on
   MECHANISM_DESIGN to srdqn to improve the COOPERATIVE_POLICIES, and then we
   empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  2022 ieee.

AB due to industrialization and informatization of the CONSTRUCTION_INDUSTRY,
   prefabricated CONSTRUCTION has attracted WIDE_ATTENTION from both RESEARCH
   and PRACTITIONER_COMMUNITIES. in prefabricated CONSTRUCTION, there are
   exacting requirements for INFORMATION_SHARING. also, data in a
   PREFABRICATED_COMPONENT SUPPLY_CHAIN tend to be dispersed in DESIGN,
   PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION and other stages.  in other words, SUCH_DATA are
   significantly multi_source heterogeneous.  without an EFFECTIVE_WAY of
   participating in SUPPLY_CHAIN DYNAMIC_COLLABORATION, decision_making at
   VARIOUS_STAGES and RESOURCE_ALLOCATION can be extremely challenging.  this
   paper proposes a DECISION_SUPPORT_FRAMEWORK for PREFABRICATED_COMPONENT
   SUPPLY_CHAIN based on ONTOLOGY and multi_agent.  the FRAMEWORK_COMPRISES the
   ONTOLOGY_LAYER (I.e.  provides DATA_SUPPORT for the MODEL), the
   AGENT_INTERACTION_LAYER (I.e.  serves as the COMMUNICATION_HUB to coordinate
   the DATA_TRANSMISSION between modules), and the AGENT_SIMULATION_LAYER (I.e.
   SIMULATES_INTERACTION_BEHAVIOR of participants, and
   SUPPORTS_DECISION_MAKING). using the SHANGHAI_CHENXIANG_ROAD_STATION
   COMPLEX_PROJECT as a CASE_STUDY, the PAPER_DEMONSTRATES the validity of the
   proposed ONTOLOGY and multi_agent based DECISION_SUPPORT_FRAMEWORK.  2019,

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN systems are NETWORK_SYSTEMS with several SUBCHAINS each of
   which consists of facilities and DISTRIBUTION_ENTITIES (SUPPLIERS,
   MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS, and RETAILERS), and thus SUCH_SYSTEMS can be
   viewed as MULTIAGENT_SYSTEMS. CONSENSUS or COORDINATION of
   MULTIPLE_SUBCHAINS is crucial for a STABLE_MARKET SUPPLY, especially in the
   case of some SUBCHAINS suffering from PRODUCTION_INTERRUPTION, or losing
   connection with others, which become isolated SUBCHAINS in some TIME_PERIOD
   due to IRRESISTIBLE_REASONS. once some unspecified isolated SUBCHAINS
   appear, the TOPOLOGY_STRUCTURE of the SYSTEM will be changed, and thus the
   multiagent_based SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM can be modeled as a switched SYSTEM.
   this PAPER_AIMS to investigate the problem of ${h_\infty }$ CONSENSUS for
   multiagent_based SUPPLY_CHAIN systems under SWITCHING_TOPOLOGY and
   UNCERTAIN_DEMANDS. to achieve the CONSENSUS of the SYSTEM, switching
   controller is designed in which both PRODUCTION_RATE and distributed
   CONSENSUS_PROTOCOL are considered.  SUFFICIENT_CONDITIONS are given such
   that the WHOLE_SYSTEM reaches CONSENSUS and DESIRABLE_ATTENUATION of
   BULLWHIP_EFFECT with an AVERAGE_DWELL_TIME_APPROACH, which allows some
   SUBCHAINS to be isolated in some TIME_PERIODS. finally, a SIMULATION_EXAMPLE
   is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.   2013

AB in the SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_RESEARCH_FIELD, the analysis of
   COLLABORATIVE_STRATEGIES and the JOINT_MANAGEMENT of INVENTORY and TRANSPORT
   of goods have increased the attention or academics and practitioners due to
   the everyday bigger amount of FREIGHT flows, the COMPLEXITY of the
   LOGISTICS_SCENARIOS and the CURRENT_CHANGES and tendencies in the
   GOODS_INTERCHANGE_PROCESS. however, the COMPUTATIONAL_COMPLEXITY and the
   problems that may arise in the INTEGRATION_PROCESSES of
   DIFFERENT_PARTICIPANT_ACTORS become the majority of proposals difficult to
   implement.  in this paper, we develop a multi_agent SYSTEM for solving the
   JOINT_INVENTORY and routing ASSIGNMENT_PROBLEM. the proposed multi_agent
   SYSTEM facilitates the INTEGRATION of the DISTRIBUTION_PROCESSES and the
   INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT in a SUPPLY_NETWORK with one depot and N_CUSTOMERS. the
   multi_agent MODEL is based in the AUTONOMY of the actors to manage their
   capacity and their DEMAND, as well as in the INTEGRATION of the TRANSPORT
   and INVENTORY_PROCESS using a COLLABORATIVE_STRATEGY. to solve the resulting
   VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM, we DESIGN a COLLABORATIVE_BEHAVIOR that uses as an
   EVALUATION_TOOL a LOCAL_SEARCH_HEURISTIC with a 2_opt operator.  the MODEL
   for the INVENTORY and routing assignment is implemented on the java_based
   SOFTWARE_PLATFORM_JADE. the collaboration_based PROCESS in the multi_agent
   SYSTEM demonstrates the usefulness of the DISTRIBUTED_COMPUTING to decrease
   the TOTAL_COST in the LOGISTICS_OPERATION.  SPRINGER_NATURE_SWITZERLAND_AG

AB VALUE_CHAIN is identified as the generator of the METABOLIC_RIFT between
   nature and society.  however, the SUSTAINABLE_VALUE_CHAIN can mitigate and
   reverse this rift.  in this paper, firstly, a REVIEW of the
   MAIN_DIGITAL_ENABLERS of INDUSTRY_4.0 and the CURRENT_STATE of cognitive
   MANUFACTURING is carried out.  secondly, cyber_physical systems are
   conceived from the HOLONIC_PARADIGM, as an ORGANIZATIONAL_ENABLER for the
   whole of ENABLERS. thirdly, the BIJECTIVE_RELATIONSHIP between
   HOLONIC_PARADIGM and container_based TECHNOLOGY is analyzed.  this
   TECHNOLOGY allows mapping the physical and VIRTUAL_HOLON as an
   INTELLIGENT_AGENT embodied at the edge, fog and CLOUD_LEVEL, with physical
   and VIRTUAL_PART. finally, the proposed HOLONIC_SYSTEM based on the
   cyber_physical holon is developed through multi_agent systems based on
   CONTAINER_TECHNOLOGY. the proposed SYSTEM allows to MODEL the metabolism of
   MANUFACTURING_SYSTEMS, from a cell MANUFACTURING to WHOLE_VALUE_CHAIN, in

AB the partnership SUPPLY of MARKET_NEEDS is one of the most regarded
   orientations in RECENT_YEARS. in this paper, a COMPETITIVE_MODEL is designed
   in partnership SUPPLY_NETWORKS including PARENT_FIRMS (brands),
   MANUFACTURING PLANTS, GOVERNMENTAL_LOGISTICS_COMPANY and franchised stores.
   in the raised scheme, the involved SUPPLY_NETWORKS seek to develop their
   upstream and downstream partnerships (respectively with MANUFACTURING PLANTS
   and franchised stores) in a COMPETITIVE_ENVIRONMENT. besides this
   cross_network COMPETITION, the downstream partners of each network develop
   some VIRTUAL_ALLIANCES. in SUCH_ALLIANCES, each of the involved members,
   further pursuing ITS OWN_INTERESTS, aims to increase the OVERALL_SHARE of
   the PARENT_BRAND. even more striking, a multi_agent TRANSPORTATION platform
   is implemented in the DISTRIBUTION of products to meet the
   ENVIRONMENTAL_SUSTAINABILITY_REQUIREMENTS. the state_owned
   LOGISTICS_COMPANY, as the MARKET_LEADER of the cited distributed structure,
   dictates ITS STRATEGY to the SUPPLY_NETWORKS seeking to gain the most
   POSSIBLE_PARTNERSHIP_INTERACTIONS. hence, in this paper, a multi_level
   competition_oriented problem is considered in the partnership
   SUPPLY_NETWORKS and formulated upon MULTIPLE_HIERARCHICAL_STAGES. due to the
   np_hardness of the problem and given ITS structural features, a
   MATHEURISTIC_APPROACH based on a combination of the
   BENDERS_DECOMPOSITION_METHOD and PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHM is
   developed.  the proposed solving approach is compared against a gaming_based
   HEURISTIC and also a PURE_BENDERS_DECOMPOSITION. the results of the
   evaluations indicate the superiority of the suggested HYBRID_APPROACH,
   especially in large_scale instances.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN INTEGRATION has become one of the most ATTRACTIVE_TOPICS for
   researchers in RECENT_YEARS. one of the advantages of this INTEGRATION is in
   improving OVERALL_PROFIT in comparison to SEPARATE_DECISIONS. in this study,
   an integrated SCHEDULING and DISTRIBUTION_PROBLEM is investigated.  one of
   the contributions of this paper is to study this problem from a multi_agent
   viewpoint.  in this case, each AGENT has a set of jobs with ITS
   OWN_OBJECTIVE and compete with each other to acquire SUPPLY_CHAIN_RESOURCES.
   here, a two_agent problem is discussed where the objectives of the AGENTS
   are the minimization of the TOTAL_TARDINESS and the TOTAL_COST of
   DISTRIBUTION. a MATHEMATICAL_FORMULATION and two HEURISTICS based on
   DECOMPOSITION_APPROACHES are presented.  in the first approach, a modified
   BENDERS_DECOMPOSITION is presented.  also, some VALID_INEQUALITIES are
   introduced to increase the CONVERGENCE_SPEED of this ALGORITHM. in the
   second approach, a DECOMPOSITION and cutting approach is developed.  the
   results represent the GOOD_PERFORMANCE of both ALGORITHMS in comparison to
   other EXACT_METHODS.  2020 INFORMA_UK limited, trading as taylor &

AB VOLATILE_MARKETS with strongly fluctuating CUSTOMER_DEMAND and uncertainties
   in the global SUPPLY_CHAIN challenge MANUFACTURING COMPANIES with increasing
   COMPLEXITY. a flexible, RECONFIGURABLE_PRODUCTION_SYSTEM like the concept of
   MODULAR_PRODUCTION by kern is one way to meet these challenges and at the
   same time to produce more efficiently.  SUCH_PLANTS can quickly adapt to
   NEW_PRODUCTION_DEMANDS, but also come with CHALLENGING_REQUIREMENTS on the
   PLANNING and CONTROL of PRODUCTION_PROGRAMS. to fulfil these requirements,
   NEW_INFORMATION_STRUCTURES are needed.  PREVIOUS_APPROACHES, as
   traditionally prevalent in the AUTOMOTIVE_INDUSTRY, are structured rigidly
   hierarchical leading to MONOLITHIC_SYSTEMS. these are designed for
   STATIC_PRODUCTION_CYCLES and therefore offer only limited FLEXIBILITY. to
   reach a higher FLEXIBILITY, NEW_INFORMATION_STRUCTURES are needed which
   enable centralized as well as DECENTRALIZED DECISION_MAKING. one approach to
   meet these requirements are multi_agent systems (MAS). in this paper a
   DESIGN_APPROACH for deploying a semi_heterarchical SYSTEM_STRUCTURE is
   presented that puts SPECIAL_EMPHASIS on a RESILIENT_PRODUCTION_PLANNING and
   execution with the help of ASSET_ADMINISTRATION_SHELLS (aas). the potential
   of aas for the self_description of industrie 4.0 COMPONENTS and AGENTS in
   HOLONIC_MANUFACTURING_SYSTEMS as well as their usefulness as

AB multi_agent systems (MAS) are built around the CENTRAL_NOTIONS of AGENTS,
   INTERACTION, and ENVIRONMENT. AGENTS are AUTONOMOUS_COMPUTATIONAL_ENTITIES
   able to pro_actively PURSUE_GOALS, and re_actively adapt to ENVIRONMENT
   change.  in doing so, they leverage on their social and situated
   capabilities: interacting with peers, and perceiving/acting on the
   ENVIRONMENT. the relevance of MAS is steadily growing as they are
   extensively and increasingly used to MODEL, simulate, and build
   HETEROGENEOUS_SYSTEMS across many DIFFERENT_APPLICATION_SCENARIOS and
   BUSINESS_DOMAINS, ranging from LOGISTICS to SOCIAL_SCIENCES, from ROBOTICS
   to SUPPLY_CHAIN, and more.  the reason behind such a widespread and

AB the INTERNET_OF_THINGS (IOT) provides advanced services by interconnecting a
   HUGE_NUMBER of HETEROGENEOUS_SMART_THINGS (virtual or PHYSICAL_DEVICES)
   through existing INTEROPERABLE_INFORMATION and COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES.
   due to ITS TENUOUS_NATURE, IOT is vulnerable to DIFFERENT_TYPES of attacks,
   which usually LEAD to exposure of secrets from the node to the attacker, and
   compromises the authenticity, integrity, and real_time delivery of data.  as
   such, it is important to have a TRUST and REPUTATION_MODEL to evaluate the
   TRUSTWORTHINESS of the DIFFERENT_PLAYERS in IOT_SETTINGS. trust_based
   REPUTATION_MODELS have been developed for this purpose, but to date, no
   attempts have been made to compare their PERFORMANCE in an IOT_SETTING. the
   OBJECTIVE of this work is to implement a multi_agent framework to simulate a
   SMART_FACTORY SUPPLY_CHAIN using iiot and evaluate the PERFORMANCE of three
   well_known MODELS: regret, s_iot, and r_d_c in terms of TRUSTWORTHINESS and
   CASH_UTILITY. based on our EXPERIMENTS, regret performed the best among the
   three MODELS in terms of evaluating TRUSTWORTHINESS and r_d_c gained the

AB ways to improve the EFFICIENCY of the functioning of COMPLETE_LOGISTIC
   SUPPLY_CHAIN (clsc) in the framework of the concept of INDUSTRY_4.0 are

   INTEGRATION of PRODUCTION and NETWORK_COMMUNICATIONS, the formation of
   DIRECT_LINKS of PRODUCTION_CHAINS from ordering a product to receiving it by
   the consumer as soon as possible with MAXIMUM_PROCESS_EFFICIENCY, determine

AB in RECENT_YEARS, CUSTOMER_NEEDS have diversified and COMPANIES have been
   forced to deliver products quickly to their CUSTOMERS.
   DISTRIBUTION_WAREHOUSES play an IMPORTANT_ROLE in improving the EFFICIENCY
   of the entire SUPPLY_CHAIN, and improving the EFFICIENCY of the
   ORDER_PREPARATION_OPERATION, otherwise known as order picking, is therefore
   essential.  this RESEARCH_MODELS an order picking OPERATION in which two or
   more pickers are operating simultaneously, and the OPTIMAL_DESIGN for
   OPERATION_EFFICIENCY is analyzed.  here, the PICKER_TARGETS multi_picking,
   which entails the collection of MULTIPLE_PRODUCTS in one tour, and the
   picker always selects the SHORTEST_ROUTE for collecting the products.  in
   this RESEARCH, the behavior of the pickers is modeled using a multi_agent
   SYSTEM, such that MULTIPLE_PICKERS pass one another in the WAREHOUSE and a
   CONFLICT due to EXCESSIVE_CONGESTION is reproduced.  the effect prompted by
   changes to both the layout and the STORAGE_ASSIGNMENT using the
   AFOREMENTIONED_MODEL was clarified.  the SIMULATION_RESULTS show that an
   OPTIMAL_WAREHOUSE_DESIGN based on WAREHOUSE_CHARACTERISTICS (picking
   AREA_SIZE and differences in the DEMAND_FREQUENCY of each product) and the
   number of pickers operating simultaneously significantly affects the
   EFFICIENCY of the order picking OPERATION. furthermore, it is possible to
   reduce PICKER_TRAVEL_TIME by using the CLASS_STORAGE_METHOD. the greater the
   difference in the DEMAND_FREQUENCY of each product, the greater the effect.

AB in RECENT_YEARS, cities and especially URBAN_MOBILITY have undergone
   REMARKABLE_CHANGES. SIGNIFICANT_ADVANCES in TECHNOLOGY have been translated
   into NEW_MOBILITY_SERVICES for both goods and people.  one evident change
   has been the transformation of TRADITIONAL_VEHICLE_FLEETS into more
   OPEN_FLEETS, in the sense that their members can proactively decide whether
   or not they are part of a CERTAIN_FLEET and whether or not they perform
   CERTAIN_SERVICES. fleets of this type make the decision_making PROCESS to be
   highly distributed, and rule out some of the typically centralized
   decisions.  the MANAGEMENT and CONTROL of this type of OPEN_FLEETS is
   severely more complex and, for this reason, the availability of
   SIMULATION_TOOLS that allow for their analysis can be very useful.  in
   accordance with this, the MAIN_CONTRIBUTION of this work is the DEVELOPMENT
   of an agent_based SIMULATION_TOOL specifically designed for the SIMULATION
   of NEW_URBAN_MOBILITY_MODELS. in this way, the tool can simulate any type of

PY 2022
AB this BOOK_EXPLORES how DIGITAL_TECHNOLOGIES have proved to be a useful and
   NECESSARY_TOOL to help ensure that local and REGIONAL_GOVERNMENTS on the
   frontline of the emergency can continue to provide ESSENTIAL_PUBLIC_SERVICES
   during the covid_19 crisis.  indeed, as the DEMAND for DIGITAL_TECHNOLOGIES
   grows, local and REGIONAL_GOVERNMENTS are increasingly committed to
   improving the lives of their citizens under the principles of PRIVACY,
   freedom of expression and democracy.  the DIGITAL_REVOLUTION began between
   the LATE_1950S and 1970s and represents the evolution of TECHNOLOGY from the
   mechanical and analog to the digital.  the advent of DIGITAL_TECHNOLOGY has
   also changed how HUMANS_COMMUNICATE today using COMPUTERS, smartphones and
   the INTERNET. further, the DIGITAL_REVOLUTION has made a TREMENDOUS_WEALTH
   of INFORMATION_ACCESSIBLE to virtually everyone.  in turn, the BOOK_FOCUSES
   on key challenges for local and REGIONAL_GOVERNMENTS concerning
   DIGITAL_TECHNOLOGIES during this crisis, e.g.  the balance between PRIVACY
   and SECURITY, the digital divide, and accessibility.  PRIVACY is a challenge
   in the mitigation of covid_19, as governments rely on DIGITAL_TECHNOLOGIES
   like contact_tracking apps and BIG_DATA to help TRACE_PEOPLES_PATTERNS and
   movements.  while these methods are controversial and may infringe on rights
   to PRIVACY, they also appear to be EFFECTIVE_MEASURES for rapidly
   controlling and limiting the spread of the virus.  next, the BOOK_DISCUSSES
   the 10 TECHNOLOGY_TRENDS that can help build a RESILIENT_SOCIETY, as well as
   their effects on how we do business, how we work, how we produce goods, how
   we learn, how we seek MEDICAL_SERVICES and how we entertain ourselves.
   lastly, the BOOK_ADDRESSES a range of diversified technologies, e.g.  online
   shopping and ROBOT_DELIVERIES, digital and CONTACTLESS_PAYMENTS,

   chose to talk about dr and ITS CONTROL_SYSTEMS, which has become a MAIN_PART
   of the SYSTEM_OPERATIONS in the sg driven restructured POWER_SYSTEMS around

   most recent challenges of dr such as the HEURISTIC_OPTIMIZATION, the
   SCHEDULING_STRUCTURES, the load shifting etc.  then we presented
   CONTROL_METHODS of dr on SMART_GRIDS. in particularly we highlighted two
   SPECIFIC_METHODS of based CONTROL_SYSTEMS: 'the multi_agent SYSTEM' (MAS),

AB several approaches for strategic and TACTICAL_INTEGRATION of SUPPLY_CHAINS
   considering the DEMAND_MANAGEMENT_PROCESS have been proposed in the
   literature.  however, in the context of INDUSTRY_4.0, there is a lack of
   studies related to the SCHEDULING and rescheduling PROCESS integrating
   industries on the OPERATIONAL_LEVEL. this paper proposes a
   NOVEL_HYBRID_FLOW_SHOP rescheduling procedure to address the INTEGRATION, on
   the OPERATIONAL_LEVEL, of a CONTRACT_MANUFACTURER, who handles
   PRODUCTION_EXECUTION and INVENTORY_CONTROL, and their INDUSTRIAL_CUSTOMERS,
   who are in charge of the DELIVERY_PLANNING_PROCESS. the RESEARCH_QUESTION
   emerged from the EMPIRICAL_PROBLEM of connecting a CONTRACT_MANUFACTURER
   with ITS INDUSTRIAL_CUSTOMERS. in alignment with the findings in the
   LITERATURE_REVIEW, based on an updated CONCEPTUAL_MODEL, a
   REAL_HYBRID_FLOW_SHOP was modelled using a multi_method approach that
   combines DISCRETE_EVENT and agent_based SIMULATION. the results show
   improvements in OVERALL_PRODUCTION and DELIVERY_PERFORMANCE. one can say
   that this is the first time that a PRODUCTION_RESCHEDULING problem is
   handled considering INDUSTRIES_INTEGRATION at the OPERATIONAL_LEVEL. even
   though the PRIMARY_MOTIVATION of this RESEARCH was to solve a

AB the LOGISTICS of transporting a package from a STORAGE_FACILITY to the
   consumer'S front door usually employs highly specialized ROBOTS often times
   splitting sub_tasks up to DIFFERENT_SYSTEMS, e.g., MANIPULATOR_ARMS to sort
   and wheeled VEHICLES to deliver.  more RECENT_ENDEAVORS_ATTEMPT to have a
   unified approach with legged and HUMANOID_ROBOTS. these SOLUTIONS, however,
   occupy LARGE_AMOUNTS of space thus reducing the number of packages that can
   fit into a DELIVERY_VEHICLE. as a result, these BULKY_ROBOTIC_SYSTEMS often
   reduce the potential for SCALABILITY and TASK_PARALLELIZATION. in this
   paper, we INTRODUCE_LIMMS (latching INTELLIGENT_MODULAR_MOBILITY_SYSTEM) to
   address both the manipulation and DELIVERY_PORTION of a typical last_mile
   delivery while maintaining a MINIMAL_SPATIAL_FOOTPRINT. limms is a
   symmetrically designed, 6_DEGREE_OF_FREEDOM (dof) appendage_like robot with
   WHEELS and latching MECHANISMS at both ends.  by latching onto a surface and
   anchoring at one end, limms can function as a traditional 6_dof manipulator
   arm.  on the other hand, MULTIPLE_LIMMS can latch onto a single box and
   behave like a legged ROBOTIC_SYSTEM where the package is the body.  during
   transit, LIMMS_FOLDS up compactly and takes up much less space compared to
   TRADITIONAL_ROBOTIC_SYSTEMS. a LARGE_GROUP of LIMMS_UNITS can fit inside of
   a single DELIVERY_VEHICLE, opening the potential for
   NEW_DELIVERY_OPTIMIZATION and HYBRID_PLANNING_METHODS never done before.  in
   this paper, the feasibility of limms is studied and presented using a
   HARDWARE_PROTOTYPE as well as SIMULATION_RESULTS for a range of sub_tasks in
   a typical last_mile delivery.   2022 ieee.

AB in MOBILE_PHONE SUPPLY_CHAINS, consumers can choose handsets and
   TELECOMMUNICATION_SERVICES as a bundled package or buy handsets and services
   independently.  this ARTICLE develops a multi_agent SIMULATION_MODEL to
   EXPLORE_PRICE, subsidy and bundling decisions for competing MOBILE_PHONE
   SUPPLY_CHAINS with NETWORK_EXTERNALITY, where each CHAIN includes one
   MOBILE_PHONE_MANUFACTURER and one SERVICE_OPERATOR. there are two
   BUNDLING_STRATEGIES: free or bundled.  the results indicate that: 1) if the
   impact of NETWORK_EXTERNALITY is not too small, then
   COMPETITIVE_DIFFERENTIATION can be formed when one PARTY_ADOPTS a bundled
   one.  if bundled scenario is adopted by both, the TOTAL_PROFIT is reduced.
   consequently, both SERVICE_OPERATORS and MANUFACTURERS choose (accept)
   different BUNDLING_STRATEGIES; 2) NETWORK_EXTERNALITY and
   CONSUMER_HETEROGENEITY both increase the advantage of bundled scenario in
   the ASYMMETRIC_SETTING; 3) when the effect of NETWORK_EXTERNALITY is
   sufficiently small, FREE_SCENARIO is dominant; and 4) CONSUMER_HETEROGENEITY
   can ALLEVIATE_COMPETITION in the SYMMETRIC_SETTINGS. copyright  2020, igi

AB we study the INCENTIVE_DESIGN_DECISION of a firm that outsources ITS online
   MARKETING and OPERATIONAL_BUSINESS_LINES to PROFESSIONAL_EXTERNAL and
   INTERNAL_SERVICE_PROVIDERS under the PRINCIPALAGENT_FRAMEWORK.
   CUSTOMER_SATISFACTION is represented as the composite of the AGENTS' SALES
   and quality_control efforts via the DISCONFIRMATION_MODEL, and is introduced
   into the DEMAND_MODEL and INCENTIVE_CONTRACTS. two scenarios corresponding
   to whether the brand OWNER_DELEGATES_BUSINESS to a single AGENT or to
   MULTIPLE_AGENTS are studied.  we derive the brand owner'S optimal CONTRACTS
   and the AGENTS' EFFORT_LEVELS and conduct EXTENSIVE_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSES
   regarding the influences of MODEL_PARAMETERS. we find that increases in the
   MEASURE_ACCURACY of CUSTOMER_SATISFACTION can bring SIGNIFICANT_BENEFIT to
   the firm'S PROFITABILITY, and explore how it is affected by SYSTEM_FACTORS.
   specifically, the BENEFIT is more substantial when the MARGINAL_COST of
   quality_control effort is relatively smaller than the MARGINAL_COST of
   SALES_EFFORT. an INTERESTING_DISCOVERY is that the brand owner always earns
   more profit by OUTSOURCING business to MULTIPLE_AGENTS than to a single
   AGENT, mainly because of his inflexibility in reaching a balance between
   inducing higher EFFORT_LEVELS and providing a SUFFICIENT_RISK_PREMIUM in the
   singe_agent case.  this PROFIT_GAP can be expanded by incentivizing both
   AGENTS on CUSTOMER_SATISFACTION_MEASURES, and is shown quite significant

AB providing high_quality service to all users is a difficult and
   INEFFICIENT_STRATEGY for e_commerce providers, especially when
   WEB_SERVERS_EXPERIENCE_OVERLOAD_CONDITIONS that cause increased
   RESPONSE_TIME and REQUEST_REJECTIONS, leading to USER_FRUSTRATION and
   reduced revenue.  in an e_commerce SYSTEM, CUSTOMER_WEB_SESSIONS have
   differing values for SERVICE_PROVIDERS. these tend to: give preference to
   CUSTOMER_WEB_SESSIONS that are likely to bring more profit by providing
   better SERVICE_QUALITY. this paper proposes a reinforcement_learning based
   adaptive e_commerce SYSTEM_MODEL that adapts the SERVICE_QUALITY_LEVEL for
   DIFFERENT_WEB_SESSIONS within the CUSTOMERS_NAVIGATION in order to
   MAXIMIZE_TOTAL_PROFIT. the e_commerce SYSTEM is considered as an electronic
   SUPPLY_CHAIN which includes a network of basic e_ providers used to SUPPLY
   e_commerce services for END_CUSTOMERS. the LEARNER_AGENT noted as e_commerce
   SUPPLY_CHAIN MANAGER (ecscm) AGENT_ALLOCATES a SERVICE_QUALITY_LEVEL to the
   CUSTOMERS_REQUEST based on his/her NAVIGATION pattern in the e_commerce
   website and selects an optimized combination of SERVICE_PROVIDERS to respond
   to the CUSTOMERS_REQUEST. to evaluate the proposed MODEL, a
   MULTI_AGENT_FRAMEWORK composed of three AGENT_TYPES, the ECSCM_AGENT,
   CUSTOMER_AGENT (buyer/browser) and SERVICE_PROVIDER_AGENT, is employed.
   EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS show that the proposed MODEL_IMPROVES_TOTAL_PROFITS
   through COST_REDUCTION and REVENUE_ENHANCEMENT simultaneously and
   ENCOURAGES_CUSTOMERS to purchase from the website through
   SERVICE_QUALITY_ADAPTATION.  2019, SPRINGER_FACHMEDIEN_WIESBADEN_GMBH,

AB currently, to solve the problem of MODELING negotiations between
   SUPPLY_CHAIN participants, multi_agent systems with more than two AGENTS are
   used.  to formalize the NEGOTIATION_PROCESS between AGENTS, the
   MONOTONIC_CONCESSION_PROTOCOL was used, which was modified to allow the use
   of more than two AGENTS. as a STRATEGY, the ZEUTHEN_STRATEGY for the
   PROTOCOL was used, which was modified to allow the use of more than two
   AGENTS, and also the choice of the AGREEMENT_OPTION for the conceding AGENT
   for this STRATEGY was formalized.  the agreement, the UTILITY_FUNCTION and
   the risk of going into CONFLICT for the PROTOCOL were formalized, which
   allows us to consider the DISTRIBUTION of tasks between AGENTS as a modified
   ASSIGNMENT_PROBLEM, in which all AGENTS should receive approximately the
   same income from solving problems.  the proposed approach can be used in
   various multi_agent systems for MODELING negotiations.  copyright  2022 for

   UDDI_CLOUD_LEVEL and the AGENT_LEVEL. the UDDI_CLOUD_LEVEL allows

AB with the TREMENDOUS_INCREASE in the globalization of trade the corresponding
   SUPPLY_CHAINS supporting the MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION and SUPPLY of goods
   has become extremely complex.  INTELLIGENT_AGENTS can help with the problem
   of EFFECTIVE_MANAGEMENT of these complex SUPPLY_CHAINS. in this paper we
   introduce the DESIGN, implementation and testing of an INTELLIGENT_AGENT for
   handling PROCUREMENT, CUSTOMER_SALES, and SCHEDULING of PRODUCTION in a
   stylized SUPPLY_CHAIN_ENVIRONMENT. the SUPPLY_CHAIN_ENVIRONMENT used in this
   paper is modeled after the trading AGENT_COMPETITION that is held annually
   to choose the best AGENT for managing a SUPPLY_CHAIN. our SUPPLY_CHAIN
   AGENT, which we call scmaster, uses DYNAMIC_INVENTORY_CONTROL and
   VARIOUS_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_TECHNIQUES like q_learning, softmax, _greedy,
   and sliding WINDOW_PROTOCOL to make our AGENT_ADAPT dynamically to the
   CHANGING_ENVIRONMENT created by competing AGENTS. a multi_agent
   SIMULATION_ENVIRONMENT is developed in JAVA to test the efficacy of our
   AGENT_DESIGN. two competing AGENTS are created modeled after the winners of
   past trading AGENT_COMPETITIONS and are tested against our AGENT in
   VARIOUS_EXPERIMENTAL_DESIGNS. results of SIMULATIONS show that our AGENT has
   better PERFORMANCE compared to the other AGENTS.  2018, springer_verlag gmbh

   INDUSTRIAL_RESOURCES, in order to maintain a HIGH_LEVEL of ADAPTABILITY and
   EFFICIENCY. CLASSICAL_COMBINATORIAL or HEURISTIC_METHODS and TOOLS cannot
   provide ADEQUATE_SOLUTIONS for real_time RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT. purpose:
   DEVELOPMENT of a method for PLANNING INDUSTRIAL_RESOURCES based on
   multi_agent technologies and ONTOLOGY, in order to adapt the SYSTEM to
   UNFORESEEN_EVENTS, such as NEW_ORDERS, UNAVAILABLE_RESOURCES, etc.  results:
   an ADAPTIVE_PLANNING_METHOD has been developed, in which AGENTS continuously
   improve the SYSTEM_PERFORMANCE in REAL_TIME by identifying and resolving
   CONFLICT_SITUATIONS caused by UNFORESEEN_EVENTS. to adjust multi_agent
   PLANNING to SPECIFIC_FEATURES of the PRODUCTION_PROCESS, SEMANTIC_NETWORKS
   (ONTOLOGIES) are used, which are the basis of ONTOLOGICAL_KNOWLEDGE_BASES
   for storing information about the peculiarities of a PARTICULAR_ENTERPRISE.
   in this regard, the following elements have been developed: the basic
   PLANNING ONTOLOGY, an ONTOLOGY_EDITOR for creating a specialized
   ENTERPRISE_ONTOLOGY, a KNOWLEDGE_BASE in the form of a SEMANTIC_WIKIPEDIA
   for the ENTERPRISE, and a multi_agent scheduler which can be customized
   using the basic and specialized ONTOLOGIES in accordance with
   SPECIFIC_PRODUCTION features and requirements for the
   TECHNOLOGICAL_OPERATIONS. PRACTICAL_RELEVANCE: application of the SYSTEM
   developed with the method of PLANNING INDUSTRIAL_RESOURCES is not limited to
   machine_building ENTERPRISES, but can be recommended for managing projects,

AB getting ENTERPRISES to reduce CARBON_EMISSIONS cooperatively is an
   EFFECTIVE_WAY of SHARING the burden of CARBON_TAXATION. it is easier for
   CORE_ENTERPRISES to promote COOPERATION because of their DOMINANT_POSITIONS
   in the SUPPLY_CHAIN. the MAIN_GOAL of this paper is to provide a
   POTENTIAL_METHOD for the CORE_ENTERPRISE to organize this COOPERATION
   successfully.  we explore how CORE_ENTERPRISES should allocate their
   REDUCTION_INVESTMENTS and coordinate the selection of
   TECHNOLOGY_UPGRADE_STRATEGIES so as to maximize their profits without
   disrupting the profits of cooperating ENTERPRISES for a SUPPLY_CHAIN where
   there are non_equivalent relationships between ENTERPRISES. the
   MAIN_HYPOTHESES are that each ENTERPRISE only produces one product, and each
   PRODUCTION_PROCESS in each ENTERPRISE can only select one
   PRODUCTION_TECHNOLOGY, and the INTERMEDIATE_PRODUCTS are mainly traded among
   COOPERATIVE_ENTERPRISES. a MODEL based on
   INDEPENDENT_CARBON_EMISSION_REDUCTION (MODEL_I) is first constructed and
   used to analyze each ENTERPRISES' BASIC_INFORMATION when they reduce
   CARBON_EMISSION without COOPERATION (considering TOTAL_COSTS, profits, and
   so on). then, based on this information, a MODEL including COOPERATION is
   proposed (MODEL_II). in MODEL_II, the ENTERPRISES are divided into core and
   COOPERATIVE_ENTERPRISES and both CAPITAL and TECHNICAL_COOPERATION are
   considered.  a multi_agent SYSTEM is presented to simulate the negotiations
   between the ENTERPRISES and is then used to solve MODEL_II. finally, a
   NUMERICAL_EXAMPLE is considered to examine the feasibility of the proposed
   MODEL. the results indicate that a
   COOPERATIVE_CARBON_EMISSION_REDUCTION_STRATEGY has more advantages than the
   INDEPENDENT_CARBON_EMISSION_REDUCTION_APPROACH. a NOTABLE_ADVANTAGE is that
   it can further rationalize the EMISSION_REDUCTION_STRUCTURE of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN through RATIONAL_ALLOCATION of REDUCTION_INVESTMENTS and thus
   further RESTORES_PROFITS.  2017 ELSEVIER_LTD

AB QUALITY_ISSUES in a REMANUFACTURING SUPPLY_CHAIN with non_waste returns have
   been reported many times.  to address these issues, the government proposes
   DIFFERENT_QUALITY_REGULATION_POLICIES. this paper develops a multi_agent
   SIMULATION_MODEL to study how the QUALITY_REGULATION_POLICY_AFFECTS the
   PERFORMANCE of a REMANUFACTURING SUPPLY_CHAIN with non_waste returns.  here,
   the MAIN_PERFORMANCE includes profit and HAZARD_RATIO of products.  our
   results indicate that self_regulation of the MARKET cannot realize a
   DESIRABLE_OUTCOME (LOW_HAZARD_RATIO and HIGH_MANUFACTURERS_PROFIT).
   adjusting QUALITY_REGULATION_PROBABILITY is more efficient than adjusting
   the penalty for INFERIOR_PRODUCTS. from the view of increasing
   MANUFACTURERS_AVERAGE_PROFIT, or improving the GOVERNMENTS_EFFICIENCY, the
   best POLICY is the solely adjusting SUPERVISION_PROBABILITY_POLICY. from the
   view of reducing HAZARD_RATIO, the best POLICY is adjusting SUPERVISION
   probability_ penalty POLICY. the APPROPRIATE_PENALTY for INFERIOR_PRODUCTS
   can realize the DESIRABLE_OUTCOME. with an increasing
   SUPERVISION_PROBABILITY, the HAZARD_RATIO_DECREASES, and the
   MANUFACTURERS_AVERAGE_PROFIT_INCREASES because the REMANUFACTURING COST and
   penalty for INFERIOR_PRODUCTS decrease.  2018,  2018 INFORMA_UK limited,

AB MULTIAGENT_SYSTEMS are characterized by DECENTRALIZED decision_making by the
   (semi)AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS and localized COMMUNICATION or INFORMATION_EXCHANGE
   among the neighboring AGENTS. supply_demand NETWORKS form the backbones of
   both services and MANUFACTURING_INDUSTRIES, and need to operate as
   efficiently as possible to yield optimized returns.  in this letter, we
   bring the notion of MULTIAGENT_SYSTEMS to clustered supply_demand NETWORKS
   such that each SUPPLIER_ACTS as an AGENT. consequently, we adapt
   consensus_based AUCTION bidding methods to optimize the assignment of
   demands to the SUPPLIERS with known COMMUNICATION_PATHWAYS and
   RESOURCE_CONSTRAINTS. results on moderately LARGE_NETWORKS show

AB recently, a lot of attention has been brought to the DEEP_SPACE MINING
   missions.  MINING of the NATURAL_RESOURCES from near_earth celestial bodies
   like MOON, near_earth ASTEROIDS (neas), comets and meteors is one of the
   POSSIBLE_WAYS for solving of the problem of lack of NATURAL_RESOURCES on
   EARTH. the CALCULATIONS in the ARTICLE_SHOW that CURRENT_COST of the launch
   and space MINING TECHNOLOGY_READINESS_LEVEL do not allow us to implement
   EXTRATERRESTRIAL_RESOURCES to EARTH_ECONOMY, due to the extremely HIGH_COST
   comparing to the TERRESTRIAL_RESOURCES. the goal of this paper is to
   ESTIMATE_ECONOMICAL_BENEFITS of ASTEROID_MINING for MOON and MARS_COLONIES.
   we know from PLANETARY_RESEARCH_PROGRAMS that WATER_RESOURCES on the MOON
   are limited and most of them are possibly concentrated near the south pole.
   on mars, we know that WATER_ICE is concentrated near the POLAR_REGIONS in
   form of ice (polar layered deposits) or near_surface permafrost.  in order
   to enable in_situ RESOURCE_UTILIZATION (FUEL_GENERATION,
   BUILDING_MATERIALS_ETC) a number of ADDITIONAL_MATERIALS have to be brought
   to the MOON or mars.  we propose to consider a NETWORK_ECONOMY that includes
   near_earth ASTEROIDS (nea), EARTH, MOON, ASTEROID_BELT, mars and ITS
   SATELLITES as a source of materials for SOLAR_SYSTEM_COLONIZATION. for
   example, materials contained in nea may be very useful to this task.
   approximately 10% of known neas are more accessible than the MOON in terms
   of required delta_v for transfer.  moreover, ASTEROIDS are a POSSIBLE_SOURCE
   of PLATINUM_GROUP_METALS (pgm) and water according to the
   GROUND_OBSERVATIONS. to SIMULATE_SCENARIOS on COLONY_GROWTH, material
   transfer and ASTEROID_EXPLOITATION, we would like to utilize multi_agent
   NETWORK_OPTIMIZATION. we can MAP_AGENTS acting in the SOLAR_SYSTEM_ECONOMY
   to well proven SOLUTIONS in DYNAMIC_OPTIMIZATION for TRUCK_DELIVERY_SYSTEMS.
   we have constructed a SIMPLE_ONTOLOGY that includes colonies
   (RESOURCE_REQUESTS), spacecraft (RESOURCE_TRANSPORT), ASTEROIDS (resource
   SUPPLY), SATELLITES (RESOURCE_DEPOT). we have specified COST_FUNCTIONS of
   delivery and RESOURCES_AVAILABILITY to MODEL_TRANSPORTATION of water and
   other materials (e.g.  pgms) between actors in the SOLAR_SYSTEM. the goal of
   this MODELLING is to understand KEY_TECHNOLOGIES that will be required
   inside SUCH_NETWORK to prepare DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAPS today.  also, we are
   interested to MODEL POSSIBLE_SIZES of colonies of mars and MOON to make
   ASTEROID_MINING economically sensible.  2018 by the

   DECISION_MAKINGS of MAS for MATERIAL_SUPPLIER_AGENTS (msas) are made
   simultaneously.  buyers in the proposed MODEL are assumed build_to_order.
   both concessions and preferences among attributes and items are considered
   during DECISION_MAKINGS of AGENTS. it is verified that the proposed

AB CHINA has a HUGE_POTENTIAL of BIOMASS_POWER_GENERATION since it is a
   BIG_AGRICULTURAL_PRODUCER and abundant in AGRICULTURE_STRAW. however, the
   CURRENT_STRAW SUPPLY SYSTEM cannot guarantee the FEEDSTOCK_SUFFICIENCY for
   BIOMASS_POWER_PLANTS. the MAIN_REASON is the HIGH_COSTS of STRAW_COLLECTION
   and TRANSPORTATION because farmers are scattered across the country and
   farming in a small_scaled method for self_support.  this STUDY_AIMS at
   solving the issue with the introduction of chinas
   RURAL_OFFICIAL_ORGANIZATIONS to collect AGRICULTURE_STRAW in a centralized
   way and to share benefits with farmers.  we apply the approach of
   multi_agent MODELING_AND_SIMULATION to analyze the
   FARMERS_PARTICIPATION_BEHAVIOR within a co_opetition SUPPLY STRATEGY after
   the RURAL_OFFICIAL_ORGANIZATIONS are incorporated.  the results demonstrate
   that FARMERS_PARTICIPATION is positively affected by the
   COOPERATIVE_ENTHUSIASM of RURAL_OFFICIAL_ORGANIZATIONS. in addition to those
   BASIC_FACTORS, such as STRAW_PRICE, TRANSPORTATION_COST, and
   SHIPPING_DISTANCE, the BENEFIT SHARING POLICY has a SIGNIFICANT_IMPACT on
   the EQUILIBRIUM_PERCENTAGE of the COOPERATIVE_FARMERS. we recommend that the
   chinese CENTRAL_GOVERNMENT encourage and support
   RURAL_OFFICIAL_ORGANIZATIONS to participate in the AGRICULTURE_STRAW
   SUPPLY_CHAIN, and the BENEFIT SHARING POLICY should be implemented with the
   precaution against free rides.  2018 by the authors.

AB this paper proposes a SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL that enables COMPANIES with a
   SOFTWARE_AGENT to construct a flexible SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK automatically,
   assuming the network is composed of many competitors.  unlike the
   traditional SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL including AGENTS, it is impossible to manage
   the behavior of all COMPANIES directly in the structure of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK. each company can handle only ITS OWN_STRATEGY or
   PLANNING. we also propose a SIMPLE_STRATEGY for MANUFACTURING AGENTS
   focusing on INDIVIDUAL_PROFIT. our EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS demonstrate that our

   of the citizens' movements.  in this way our proposal follows a
   CROWDSOURCING approach, in which the citizens that moves in the CITY,
   because of their OWN_NEEDS, become TEMPORAL_DELIVERERS. the TECHNOLOGY
   behind our APPROACH_RELAYS on multi_agent SYSTEM techniques and complex

   can be executed using the DIFFERENT_TRANSPORTATION means and NETWORKS
   available in the CITY (PUBLIC_SYSTEM, PRIVATE_TRANSPORTATION, eco_vehicles
   SHARING systems, etc.). a complex network_based ALGORITHM is used for
   computing and proposing an optimized sustainable last MILE_DELIVERY_ROUTE to

   from the DELIVERY_TRUCKS that, in the CASE_STUDIES, are no longer needed for

AB the WORK_SIMULATES a GAME with FULL_INFORMATION with two AGENTS in the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN: one LABOR_EXCHANGE _ one ENTERPRISE. the STRATEGY of the
   ENTERPRISE is the DEMAND for LABOR_RESOURCES. the LABOR_EXCHANGE_STRATEGY is
   the party of LABOR_RESOURCES. the company provides the LABOR_EXCHANGE with
   information on the DEMAND for workers, the LABOR_EXCHANGE decides on the
   PROCUREMENT and delivery of batches of workers.  LABOR_RESOURCES as stocks
   are managed by the LABOR_EXCHANGE. thus, the MODEL proposed in the
   WORK_OBEYS the vmi (VENDOR_MANAGED_INVENTORY) concept and is a MODEL of
   COOPERATION between the LABOR_EXCHANGE and the ENTERPRISE. a multi_product
   eoq (ECONOMIC_ORDER_QUANTITY) MODEL for a two_tier SUPPLY_CHAIN is proposed.
   the task is to minimize the value of the SUPPLY_CHAIN of LABOR_RESOURCES, in
   which the OPTIMIZATION variable is the MAXIMUM_LEVEL of LABOR_SHORTAGES. the
   task takes into account the shortage of LABOR_RESOURCES, MONETARY_FINES for

AB since the advent of globalization and the evolution of organizations, the
   need for new and EFFICIENT_PROCESSES for SUPPLY_CHAIN has become urgently
   important.  one of SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_PROBLEMS is the
   SUPPLIER_SELECTION which attracts the attention of many researches.
   VARIOUS_EFFORTS are made in this context, mainly the DEVELOPMENT of
   agent_based systems to automate the PROCESS of selecting SUPPLIERS.
   NEGOTIATION is a CRITICAL_APPROACH to solve conflicting transaction between
   nodes and SCHEDULING_PROBLEMS among SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS. in this paper, we
   propose a NEGOTIATION_MODEL based on AGENTS to settle the problem of
   selecting supplier and TRANSPORTATION_PROVIDER, and then alleviating the
   HUMAN_INTERACTIONS. the NEGOTIATION_KNOWLEDGE utilized by AGENT is organized

AB the growth of the PRODUCTIVE_SECTOR has driven the evolution of
   SUPPLY_CHAINS into highly complex, dynamic and CONCURRENT_SYSTEMS.
   consequently, emerging structures have been developed through the
   INTEGRATION of advances in information and HARDWARE_TECHNOLOGIES with the
   aim of increasing effectiveness and EFFICIENCY, as INDUSTRY_4.0. in this
   context, although several works use a multi_agent approach, they offer
   limited information on the use of FORMAL_MODELS to specification the SYSTEM.
   considering the potentially SERIOUS_CONSEQUENCES of
   INACCURATE_INTEGRATION_SPECIFICATION, the use of FORMAL_TOOLS to DESIGN the
   processes for these types of SYSTEM is recommended.  considering
   SUPPLY_CHAINS as a SYSTEM of DISCRETE_EVENTS, techniques derived from
   PETRI_NETS can be used for MODELLING purposes.  SUCH_TECHNIQUES include
   colored PETRI_NETS, which have been effectively tested in hierarchical
   MODELLING, analysis and CONTROL of DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEMS, characteristics
   suitable for the specification of a SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM in an
   INDUSTRY_4.0 scenario.  in this context, this ARTICLE presents a
   SYSTEMATIC_PROCEDURE that integrates a group of guides, methods and
   techniques, to develop a representation of a SYSTEM with PROBLEM_SOLVING
   abilities, thereby facilitating the CONSTRUCTION of a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_MODEL with a multi_agent structure, which

   considered as an IMPORTANT_PRINCIPLE. in this study, for the first time,
   DIFFERENT_REQUIREMENTS of the CUSTOMERS and DIFFERENT_AIMS of the
   manufacturer are simultaneously addressed in an integrated problem of
   PRODUCTION_SCHEDULING, TRANSPORTATION, and RESOURCE_ALLOCATION. the problem
   consists of two types of CUSTOMERS, considered as the AGENTS. the first
   AGENT_ACCEPTS_TARDINESS in delivery of orders provided that the manufacturer
   pays the TARDINESS_PENALTY; whereas, the second AGENT does not accept the
   TARDY_ORDERS. the purpose is to minimize the sum of BATCH_DELIVERY_COST,
   RESOURCE_ALLOCATION, TARDINESS_PENALTY_COST, and lost SALE_COST (the
   TOTAL_NUMBER of TARDY_ORDERS). to solve the problem, two
   MATHEMATICAL_PROGRAMMING MODELS, including a mixed integer non_linear
   programming (minlp) and a mixed INTEGER_LINEAR programming (MILP) are
   proposed.  also, due to np_hard nature of the problem, two meta_heuristic
   ALGORITHMS of ADAPTIVE_GENETIC_ALGORITHM (aga) and ANT_LION_OPTIMIZATION
   (alo), as well as a HEURISTIC_ALGORITHM are proposed.  to assess the merits

AB nowadays, the dynamically CHANGING_ENVIRONMENT requires a TIMELY_RESPONSE to

   approach to improving SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE. SOFTWARE_AGENTS are
   successfully applied in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT tasks.  AGENT_BEHAVIOUR is
   defined according to the purpose of ITS DEVELOPMENT. multi_agent systems can
   be used for DOMAIN_AREAS that include negotiations between DIFFERENT_FIRMS
   or people with DIFFERENT_GOALS and CONFIDENTIAL_INFORMATION available.
   SUPPLY_CHAIN can be represented by an INTELLIGENT_AGENT set, where each
   AGENT is responsible for one or more FUNCTIONS of the SUPPLY_CHAIN. existing
   multi_agent systems have shown SUCCESSFUL_RESULTS, but these systems have
   always been developed for each case individually, there is no any universal

   SYSTEM for SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. the paper provides a SEQUENCE_OF_ACTIONS
   for the SYSTEM_DEVELOPMENT starting from discussing SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROCESSES
   and tasks that represent behaviour of AGENTS. the authors also propose to
   develop a multi_agent SYSTEM that can improve SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE and

   SUPPLIER_SELECTION based on COLLABORATION and NEGOTIATION, adapted to
   DYADIC_COLLABORATION in a SUPPLY_CHAIN_CONTEXT. SUPPLIERS and the PURCHASING
   dyad can reach an agreement on the details of the products simultaneously
   and exploit the preferences of the CUSTOMER_DYADIC_PARTNER to enlarge the
   CRITERIA_CHOICES of the products.  for this, the proposed PROTOCOL combines
   a one_to_one BILATERAL_DYADIC_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL inside the PURCHASING
   dyad along with a one_to_many multi_bilateral BARGAINING PROTOCOL between
   the PURCHASING dyad and SUPPLIERS. illustrative multi_agent

AB COOPERATION among DIFFERENT_VEHICLES is a PROMISING_CONCEPT for MOBILITY as
   a service (maas). a PRINCIPAL_PROBLEM in maas is optimizing the
   VEHICLE_ROUTES to reduce the TOTAL_TRAVEL_COST with COOPERATION. for
   example, we know that platooning among LARGE_TRUCKS could reduce the
   FUEL_COST because it decreases the AIR_RESISTANCE. TRADITIONAL_PLATOONS,
   however, cannot MODEL_COOPERATION among DIFFERENT_TYPES of VEHICLES because
   the MODEL_ASSUMES the homogeneity of VEHICLE_TYPES. we then propose a MODEL
   that permits HETEROGENEOUS_COOPERATION. targets of our MODEL include a
   LOGISTIC_SCENARIO, where a truck for the long_distance delivery also carries
   small self_driving VEHICLES for the last MILE_DELIVERY. for those purposes,
   we formalize a NEW_ROUTE_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEM with
   HETEROGENEOUS_COOPERATION, and provide ITS INTEGER_PROGRAMMING (ip)
   formulation as an EXACT_SOLVER. we evaluate our formulation through
   NUMERICAL_EXPERIMENTS using synthetic and REAL_GRAPHS. we also validate our
   concept of HETEROGENEOUS_COOPERATION for maas with examples.  2019 ieee.

AB this PAPER_AIMS at evaluating the impacts of URBAN_CONSOLIDATION_CENTERS
   (ucc) for SUSTAINABLE_CITY_LOGISTICS using ADAPTIVE_DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING
   (adp) based multi_agent SIMULATION (mas_adp). ECONOMIC_EFFICIENCY and
   ENVIRONMENT_FRIENDLINESS_CRITERIA were used to evaluate the SUSTAINABILITY
   of ucc.  the results proved that the implementation of ucc as a
   SUSTAINABLE_CITY_LOGISTICS_SCHEME is efficient in reducing 8% of the
   TOTAL_DELIVERY_COST for FREIGHT_CARRIER and reducing 36% of the
   TOTAL_EMISSIONS released to the ENVIRONMENT. it is also showed that the use
   of LEARNING AGENTS is essential to demonstrate the SUCCESSFUL_IMPLEMENTATION
   of the ucc, as it is only in the learning_based SIMULATION, UCC_OPERATOR
   could get a profit.  our SIMULATION_ANALYSIS also confirmed that compared to

AB due to ITS GLOBAL_NATURE and highly dynamic and COMPETITIVE_ENVIRONMENT,
   SUPPLY_CHAIN arguably is more exposed to DISRUPTIONS. as SUPPLY_CHAINS
   continue to grow in scale and COMPLEXITY, INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT in a
   DYNAMIC_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT is a CHALLENGING_TASK. the aim of this paper is
   to propose a multi_agent approach to quantify the impact of
   INVENTORY_DISRUPTIONS. our OBJECTIVE is to analyze the capacities of
   SUPPLY_CHAINS to cope with DISRUPTIONS before and after stockouts by
   including (proactive) MITIGATION_STRATEGIES and REACTIVE_STRATEGIES. the
   proposed SYSTEM allows providing advice to HUMAN_USERS in the form of
   DECISION_SUPPORT. a PROTOTYPE_SYSTEM is built and validated, which
   demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach.  the EXPERIMENTS show
   that the implementation of multi_agent TECHNOLOGY makes the SYSTEM much more
   flexible to make the FINAL_DECISION.  SPRINGER_NATURE_SWITZERLAND_AG 2019.

AB the last MILE_PROBLEM is crucially important for BIG_CITIES. to solve it you
   need to find the IDEAL_BALANCE between DIFFERENT_CRITERIA: the MOBILITY of
   people, comfort, UNIQUE_CHARACTERISTICS of every person, the profit of
   TRANSPORT_SYSTEM and other criteria in more COMPLEX_MODELS. to solve this
   problem for dynamic (not fixed) ROUTES_PART, we offer to use the
   ONTOLOGICAL_DESCRIPTION of citizens and TRANSPORT_SYSTEM for matching and
   multi_agent technologies to plan DIFFERENT_TYPES of TRANSPORT. to prove the
   idea a prototype of an INTELLIGENT_MULTIAGENT_TRANSPORT_SYSTEM_MATCHER was

   PERSONAL_SERVICE provided for citizens.  the MAIN_IDEA of the work is to
   take a step towards the NEW_PARADIGM where not people adjust their plans for
   TRANSPORT but SMART_TRANSPORT provides PERSONAL_SERVICE to every citizen

AB the JOINT_DESIGN of product and ITS SUPPLY_CHAIN becomes a trend in the

   we proposed a distributed ARCHITECTURE, based on AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS, in order
   to MODEL_COOPERATION_ACTIVITIES between PRODUCT_DESIGNERS and SUPPLY_CHAIN
   partners in PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT_STAGE. the MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_AIMS to choose
   a product from a set of product'S alternatives, the optimal one according to
   ITS SUPPLY_CHAIN COSTS. the proposed AGENTS are imbedded with
   OPTIMIZATION_MODELS that MINIMIZES_COSTS and specifies selected nodes and
   activities assigned to each SUPPLY_CHAIN partner.  unfortunately, COSTS are
   not a DECISIVE_CRITERION, many criteria should be integrated to choose the
   OPTIMAL_PRODUCT_DESIGN like ENVIRONMENTAL_CRITERIA. in this paper, we
   present a NEW_MODEL that integrate the ENVIRONMENTAL_CONSTRAINTS in

   MULTI_CRITERIA_DECISION_METHOD to reduce the number of product'S
   alternatives proposed by PRODUCT_DESIGNERS based on ENVIRONMENTAL_CRITERIA,
   then COSTS' OPTIMIZATION can be done to select the best PRODUCT_DESIGN. the
   goal is to avoid the HUGE_SIMULATION_TIME that can GENERATE_COSTS'
   OPTIMIZATION for all proposed PRODUCT_DESIGNS and at the same time we select

   CRUCIAL_SC_DECISION, SUSTAINABLE_SUPPLIER_EVALUATION and SELECTION_PROCESS
   have been addressed abundantly in the PREVIOUS_LITERATURE. however, this
   PROCESS has not yet been realized within INDUSTRY_4.0 scs where
   interconnection, real_time information TRANSPARENCY, TECHNICAL_ASSISTANCE
   and DECENTRALIZATION of members of a PHYSICAL_SYSTEM (I.e.,
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS) are regarded as the MAIN_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES. to narrow
   the identified gap, a multi_agent systems (MASS) approach is proposed for
   addressing SUSTAINABLE_SUPPLIER_EVALUATION and SELECTION_PROCESS to provide
   a PROPER_COMMUNICATION_CHANNEL, structured INFORMATION_EXCHANGE and
   VISIBILITY among SUPPLIERS and MANUFACTURERS. furthermore, the application
   of MASS in this PROCESS and their NATURAL_APPLICABILITY as one of the
   ENABLING_TECHNOLOGIES in moving towards INDUSTRY_4.0 scs are investigated in
   detail.  it is found that the proposed approach can help decision_makers
   inside MANUFACTURING firms to make prompt decisions with less
   HUMAN_INTERACTIONS. the merit of the developed MAS is demonstrated through a
   real_world implementation on a MEDICAL_DEVICE_MANUFACTURER. finally, the
   limitations and advantages of the proposed approach are presented together
   with some remarks for FUTURE_WORK.  2018 ELSEVIER_LTD

AB in the multi_agent SYSTEM of MANUFACTURING_ENTERPRISE SUPPLY_CHAIN, each
   NODE_ENTERPRISE has DIFFERENT_DEMANDS on the price, quality, COST,
   DELIVERY_TIME, quantity, RESPONSE_TIME, SERVICE_CONDITIONS and other
   factors, that will cause lots of CONFLICTS between SUPPLY_CHAIN partners,
   and NEGOTIATION is the BASIC_MEANS to solve these CONFLICTS. in this paper,
   a multi_objective NEGOTIATION_MODEL will be presented, and then
   NEGOTIATING_TACTICS and steps between PURCHASING AGENT and SUPPLIER_AGENT
   will be discussed.  next, an example is discussed and simulated by
   COMPUTER_TECHNOLOGY for validating the NEGOTIATING_MODEL. it is helpful to
   save NEGOTIATION_TIME and improve NEGOTIATION_EFFICIENCY, and optimize the
   MANUFACTURING_ENTERPRISE SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. based on this,

AB within the fourth stage of industrialization, ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE and in
   particular the multi_agent systems paradigm is highly adopted.  within the
   AGENT_APPROACH, the INDUSTRIAL_RESOURCES are defined as INTELLIGENT_AGENTS
   that negotiate with each other to implement DYNAMIC_RECONFIGURATION and
   reach AGILITY and higher CUSTOMER_SATISFACTION. in this paper a
   SMART_CONFIGURATION of the agent_based SYSTEM for multi_product dyadic
   SUPPLIER_SELECTION is proposed.  the OBJECTIVE is to SELECT_SUPPLIERS for
   MULTIPLE_PRODUCTS simultaneously in a VERTICAL_COLLABORATION_CONTEXT between
   the SUPPLY_CHAIN_DYAD and the SUPPLIERS. therefore, the novelty is involving
   the customer of the PURCHASING company and considering ITS preferences.
   this decision_making SYSTEM includes three steps: a dyadic SUPPLIERS
   pre_selection, a dyad_suppliers NEGOTIATION, and a PURCHASING company
   FINAL_SELECTION. for INITIAL_VALIDATION of the proposed
   CONCEPTUAL_ARCHITECTURE, NEGOTIATION_EXPERIMENTS are conducted.

   SERVICE_FAILURE (sf), good prior experience (gpe) and RECOVERY on
   OVERALL_CUSTOMER_SATISFACTION and REPURCHASE_INTENTIONS for multi_agents in
   TOURISM_SERVICE SUPPLY_CHAIN (tssc). it specifically focuses on internal and
   EXTERNAL_FAILURE and RECOVERY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/approach: the study
   employs a 223 between_subjects EXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN with 12
   DIVERSE_SCENARIOS. it aims to examine the main effects of gpe and the
   INTERACTION effects of sf and RECOVERY on OVERALL_CUSTOMER_SATISFACTION and
   REPURCHASE_INTENTIONS. findings: the MAIN_FINDINGS show that consumers do
   not show FAVORABLE_BEHAVIORAL_OUTCOMES when they have gpe with an affiliated
   party.  results of the EXPERIMENTS demonstrate that for hotels, there is no
   INTERACTION_EFFECT between failure and RECOVERY regarding
   OVERALL_CUSTOMER_SATISFACTION and REPURCHASE_INTENTIONS; however, for
   TRAVEL_AGENCIES, an INTERACTION_EFFECT has been found.  this indicates that
   an INTERNAL_FAILURE (by TRAVEL_AGENCY) should be recovered internally to
   increase the BEHAVIORAL_OUTCOMES for TRAVEL_AGENCY. however, if there is an
   EXTERNAL_FAILURE (by hotel) then the ESSENTIAL_THING is providing a
   RECOVERY. originality/value: although the SERVICE_LITERATURE covers failure
   and RECOVERY in DIVERSE_CONTEXTS, these concepts are rarely studied from a
   multi_agent perspective in the service SUPPLY_CHAIN_LITERATURE. in such a
   CHAIN, a failure by a DIFFERENT_PARTY may remain unresolved, and this may
   create a POSITIVE_EFFECT on another party, if they provide RECOVERY for the
   failure.  this means that the doer of the failure and/or RECOVERY (the party
   responsible from the failure and/or RECOVERY) may have an impact on
   BEHAVIORAL_OUTCOMES. however, PREVIOUS_LITERATURE has neglected to focus on
   the IMPORTANT_ISSUE of which entity/party performs the failure and/or
   RECOVERY, and the effect on BEHAVIORAL_OUTCOMES. by focusing on a

   framework of the EMERGENT_SYNTHESIS_APPROACH. specifically, a
   CLASS_III_SYNTHESIS_PROBLEM with reference to TOOL_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT in a
   COMPLEX_MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT is addressed.  SUCH_COMPLEX_ENVIRONMENT is
   proved to be affected by significant non_random UNCERTAINTY involving
   TOOL_DELIVERY_TIME_FLUCTUATIONS and UNPREDICTABLE_TOOL_DEMAND. to deal with
   the COMPLEXITY of the MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT, this paper presents
   BOUNDED_RATIONALITY as a characteristic of AGENTS. the purpose of the
   implemented multi_agent MANUFACTURING MODEL is to manage the UNCERTAINTY in
   the perception, action and INNER_STRUCTURE of the MANUFACTURING_SYSTEM by
   introducing BOUNDED_RATIONALITY in AGENT_CHARACTERISTICS and the

AB when managing a global SUPPLY_CHAIN, one CRITICAL_CHALLENGE encountered by
   MULTINATIONAL_ENTERPRISES (mnes) is the extension of
   CORPORATE_SOCIAL_RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) practices to SUPPLIERS in
   EMERGING_COUNTRIES. in this study, we use a multi_method approach to explore
   1) the nature of SUPPLIERS_CSR_HETEROGENEITY based on the VARIOUS_COMPONENTS
   of CSR in EMERGING_COUNTRIES, and 2) the choices of mnes for extending CSR
   to DIFFERENT_TYPES of SUPPLIERS in DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENTS. we begin with a
   SURVEY of chinese ORIGINAL_EQUIPMENT_MANUFACTURERS (oems) servicing mnes to
   examine how these SUPPLIERS vary in CSR_IMPLEMENTATION based on
   CLUSTER_ANALYSIS_RESULTS. to understand the choices made by MNE_BUYERS for
   extending CSR to their OEM_SUPPLIERS, we conduct an agent_based
   SIMULATION_STUDY considering the DYNAMICS of a SYSTEM with MULTIPLE_AGENTS
   (I.e., MNE_BUYERS, OEM_SUPPLIERS, and the government). the
   CLUSTER_ANALYSIS_RESULTS show that CSR_PRACTICES implemented by
   CHINESE_OEMS_DIFFER significantly from one another and can be classified
   into three clusters (I.e., leader, follower, and laggard). the
   SIMULATION_RESULTS provide insights into how the ADAPTION_COSTS (e.g.,
   UPGRADE_COST and COST saved by downgrading) and punitive (inspection with
   POSSIBLE_PENALTIES) and supportive (subsidies) tactics adopted by the
   government affect the choices made by MNE_BUYERS for extending CSR_PRACTICES
   to SUPPLIERS in EMERGING_COUNTRIES. moreover, we demonstrate when
   SUPPORTIVE_TACTICS are more effective than PUNITIVE_TACTICS under varying
   conditions and extend the MODEL to investigate the consequences of switching

AB large_scale MODELS are currently used for the SIMULATION, analysis and
   CONTROL of REAL_SYSTEMS, whether technical, biological, social or economic.
   in multi_agent SIMULATIONS of VIRTUAL_ECONOMIES, it is important to SCHEDULE
   a LARGE_NUMBER of AGENTS across the cities involved, in order to establish a
   functional SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK for INDUSTRIAL_PRODUCTION. this study
   describes an EXPERIMENTAL_EVALUATION of path_planning approaches in the
   field of multi_agent MODELLING_AND_SIMULATION, applied to a large_scale
   setting.  the EXPERIMENTAL_COMPARISON is based on a MODEL in which AGENTS
   represent ECONOMIC_ENTITIES and can participate in MUTUAL_INTERACTIONS. for
   the purposes of experiment, the MODEL is scaled to VARIOUS_DEGREES of
   COMPLEXITY in terms of the numbers of AGENTS and TRANSPORTATION_NODES.
   VARIOUS_NUMBERS of AGENTS are used to explore the way in which the MODEL'S
   COMPLEXITY influences the runtime of the path_planning task.  the results
   indicate that there are SIGNIFICANT_DIFFERENCES between the
   RUNTIME_PERFORMANCES associated with single approaches, for differing levels
   of SYSTEM_COMPLEXITY and MODEL_SIZES. the STUDY_REVEALS that the appropriate
   SHARING of SHORTEST_PATH_INFORMATION can significantly improve path_planning
   activities.  hence, this work extends CURRENT_RESEARCH in the field of
   path_planning for multi_agent SIMULATIONS by conducting an
   EXPERIMENTAL_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS of five distinct path_planning approaches
   and a STATISTICAL_EVALUATION of the results.  this

AB INFORMATION_SYSTEMS leave a TRACEABLE_DIGITAL_FOOTPRINT_WHENEVER an action
   is executed.  BUSINESS_PROCESS_MODELERS capture these DIGITAL_TRACES to
   understand the behavior of a SYSTEM, and to extract actual run_time MODELS
   of those BUSINESS_PROCESSES. despite the omnipresence of SUCH_TRACES, most
   organizations face SUBSTANTIAL_DIFFERENCES between the
   PROCESS_SPECIFICATIONS and the actual run_time behavior.  analyzing and
   implementing the results of systems that MODEL_BUSINESS_PROCESSES tend,
   however, to be difficult due to the INHERENT_COMPLEXITY of the MODELS.
   moreover, the observed reality in the form of lower_level real_time events,
   as recorded in EVENT_LOGS, is seldom solely explainable by higher_level
   PROCESS MODELS. in this paper, we propose an ARCHITECTURE to MODEL
   system_wide behavior by combining PROCESS_MINING with a multi_agent SYSTEM.
   DIGITAL_TRACES, in the form of EVENT_LOGS, are used to iteratively
   MINE_PROCESS_MODELS from which AGENTS can learn.  the approach is initially
   applied to a CASE_STUDY of a simplified job_shop factory in which automated
   guided VEHICLES (agvs) carry out TRANSPORTATION_TASKS. NUMERICAL_EXPERIMENTS
   show that the WORKFLOW of a PROCESS_MINING MODEL can be used to enhance the
   agent_based SYSTEM, particularly, in analyzing bottlenecks and improving
   decision_making.  2019 ieee.

AB with NATURAL_DISASTERS have become LARGE_SCALE, diversified, and frequent,
   the INDIRECT_ECONOMIC_DAMAGE due to interruption of SUPPLY_CHAIN tends to be
   large.  therefore, it is important to recover as quickly as possible for
   COMPANIES after DISASTERS. in this paper, we use REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING to
   optimize a COMPANYS_ACTION_STRATEGY so that it can efficiently recover the
   inter_firm transaction network in the SUPPLY_CHAIN after large_scale urban
   FLOODING. the AGENT holds information on disaster and SUPPLY_CHAINS obtained
   from inter_firm TRANSACTION_DATA and FLOOD_SIMULATION_ANALYSIS_DATA,
   enabling us to create a SIMULATION with detailed
   URBAN_INFRASTRUCTURE_INFORMATION by using the high_dimensional data to
   construct detailed SPATIAL_STATES. the paper also proposes an ACTION_POLICY
   for COMPANIES based on multi_agent DEEP_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING to optimize
   the behavior of COMPANIES in the RECOVERY_PROCESS. this WORK_BRIDGES the
   divide between high_dimensional data set input and post_disaster behaviors,
   enabling an ARTIFICIAL_AGENT to learn the best action to take after a
   disaster.  our results are as follows.  through LEARNING, AGENTS can recover
   efficiently after a disaster.  COMPANIES tend to secure

AB this PAPER_EXAMINES a manufacturer'S SUPPLY MANAGEMENT_STRATEGIES for
   mitigating YIELD_RISK in a complex dynamic SUPPLY_CHAIN. two strategies can
   be adopted for the manufacturer: backup and RELIABILITY_IMPROVEMENT.
   consumers may select to leave (INSTANT_CONSUMERS) or wait (delaying
   consumers) when they confront the manufacturer'S insufficient INVENTORY.
   utilizing the method of multi_agent MODELING, a manufacturer and a supplier
   are modeled as the INTELLIGENT_AGENTS with the
   REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_BEHAVIOR. the STUDY_SHOWS that: 1) when the number of
   INSTANT_CONSUMERS is small, RELIABILITY_IMPROVEMENT_STRATEGY should be
   selected; otherwise, the manufacturer should adopt a BACKUP_STRATEGY; 2)
   only when mean yield is large enough, RELIABILITY_IMPROVEMENT_STRATEGY is
   the OPTIMAL_CHOICE; and 3) if YIELD_UNCERTAINTY is small, the manufacturer
   should choose RELIABILITY_IMPROVEMENT_STRATEGY; otherwise, it is suitable to
   use a BACKUP_STRATEGY. in addition, when the MAIN_SUPPLIER can determine ITS
   OWN_WHOLESALE_PRICE, it is found that: 1) when the mean yield is small, a
   lower WHOLESALE_PRICE should be designed for the MAIN_SUPPLIER, to induce
   higher ORDER_QUANTITY under BACKUP_STRATEGY; and 2) the impact of
   YIELD_UNCERTAINTY on the manufacturer'S SUPPLY MANAGEMENT_STRATEGY can be
   changed by the MAIN_SUPPLIER'S adaptive PRICING behavior.  2013 ieee.

AB due to diversified and frequently changing demands from CUSTOMERS,
   TECHNOLOGICAL_ADVANCES and GLOBAL_COMPETITION, MANUFACTURERS rely on
   COLLABORATION with their BUSINESS_PARTNERS to share COSTS, RISKS and
   expertise.  how to take advantage of advancement of technologies to
   effectively SUPPORT_OPERATIONS and create COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE is critical
   for MANUFACTURERS to survive.  to respond to these challenges, DEVELOPMENT
   of a DYNAMIC_SCHEME to better MANAGE_COLLABORATIVE_WORKFLOWS is urgent.  in
   this paper, we will study how to develop a flexible and SCALABLE_FRAMEWORK
   to dynamically and coherently CONFIGURE_WORKFLOWS that can meet
   ORDER_REQUIREMENTS based on multi_agent systems (MAS). configuring and
   SCHEDULING_COLLABORATIVE_WORKFLOWS is a CHALLENGING_PROBLEM due to the
   COMPUTATIONAL_COMPLEXITY involved, distributed ARCHITECTURE and DEPENDENCY
   among DIFFERENT_PARTNERS_WORKFLOWS. to achieve FLEXIBILITY and reduce the
   COST and time involved in CONFIGURATION of a SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK, we
   propose an approach that combines MAS, CONTRACT_NET_PROTOCOL,
   WORKFLOW_MODELS and automated transformation of the WORKFLOW_MODELS to
   dynamically formulate the SCHEDULING_PROBLEM. to ATTAIN_SCALABILITY, we
   develop a SOLUTION_ALGORITHM to solve the OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEM by a
   COLLABORATIVE and distributed COMPUTATION_SCHEME. we implement a
   SOFTWARE_SYSTEM based on INDUSTRIAL_STANDARDS, including fipa and the
   PETRI_NET_WORKFLOW_SPECIFICATION_MODEL. in addition, we also illustrate
   effectiveness and ANALYZE_SCALABILITY of our approach by examples.  our
   APPROACH_FACILITATES_COLLABORATION between partners and provides a
   SCALABLE_SOLUTION for the increasing size of SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS.  2018,

AB RESEARCH on the integrity of SUPPLY_CHAIN_DECISIONS is constantly
   increasing.  one of the most INTERESTING_TOPICS is the INTEGRATION in
   PRODUCTION_SCHEDULING and DISTRIBUTION_DECISIONS. however, there is little
   study when MULTIPLE_AGENTS affect the SUPPLY_CHAIN_DECISIONS. in multi_agent
   SCHEDULING, when CUSTOMERS are considered as AGENTS, each of them has ITS
   OWN_JOBS with SPECIFIC_OBJECTIVE, and set of CUSTOMERS_COMPETES to PROCESS
   the jobs on the shared RESOURCES in the SUPPLY_CHAIN. this PAPER_STUDIES a
   multi_agent SCHEDULING_PROBLEM with DISTRIBUTION_DECISIONS in a
   multi_factory SUPPLY_CHAIN. to save the DELIVERY_COST, BATCH_DELIVERY is
   proposed.  it means several jobs, even for DIFFERENT_CUSTOMERS, can be
   distributed in one batch.  some jobs are scheduled to
   MINIMIZE_TOTAL_TARDINESS while TOTAL_DISTRIBUTION_COST must be minimized.  a
   mixed LINEAR_INTEGER programming formulation is proposed.  due to the
   COMPLEXITY of the problem, a novel multi_objective based on DECOMPOSITION
   which has been combined with BEES_ALGORITHM is developed to achieve
   PARETO_SOLUTIONS. two LOCAL_SEARCHES have been used to improve the
   SOLUTIONS. to evaluate the ALGORITHM, ITS PERFORMANCE has been compared with
   three well_known ALGORITHMS in the literature.  the results of the
   STUDY_SHOW that the proposed ALGORITHM_OUTPERFORMS the other tested
   ALGORITHMS.  2018 elsevier b.v.

AB to cope with increasingly COMPLEX_BUSINESS, political, and
   ECONOMIC_ENVIRONMENTS, agent_based SIMULATIONS (abs) have been proposed for
   MODELING COMPLEX_SYSTEMS such as HUMAN_SOCIETIES, TRANSPORT_SYSTEMS, and
   markets.  abs ENABLE_EXPERTS to assess the influence of EXOGENOUS_PARAMETERS
   (e.g., CLIMATE_CHANGES or STOCK_MARKET_PRICES), as well as the impact of
   POLICIES and their long_term consequences.  despite some successes, the use
   of abs is hindered by a set of interrelated factors.  first, abs are mainly
   created and used by researchers and experts in academia and specialized
   consulting firms.  second, the results of abs are typically not
   automatically integrated into the CORRESPONDING_BUSINESS_PROCESS. instead,
   the INTEGRATION is undertaken by HUMAN_USERS who are responsible for
   adjusting the implemented POLICY to take into account the results of the
   abs.  these limitations are exacerbated when the results of the abs affect
   multi_party agreements (e.g., CONTRACTS) since this requires all involved
   actors to agree on the validity of the SIMULATION, on how and when to take
   ITS results into account, and on how to split the LOSSES/gains caused by
   these changes.  to address these challenges, this PAPER_EXPLORES the
   INTEGRATION of abs into ENTERPRISE_APPLICATION_LANDSCAPES. in particular, we
   present an ARCHITECTURE that INTEGRATES_ABS into cross_organizational
   ENTERPRISE_RESOURCE_PLANNING (ERP) processes.  as part of this, we propose a
   multi_agent systems simulator for the HYPERLEDGER_BLOCKCHAIN and describe an
   example SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT scenario type to illustrate the approach.

AB this paper proposes a CROWDSOURCING approach that deals with the problem of
   last MILE_DELIVERY (lmd). the proposed approach is supported by
   MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM (MAS) techniques and makes use of a crowd of citizens
   that are moving in an URBAN_AREA for their OWN_NEEDS. the idea is to employ
   those citizens to deliver parcels on their way to their destinations.  the
   COMPLEXITY of the approach lies in integrating the
   PUBLIC_INFRASTRUCTURE_NETWORK of the CITY for the DELIVERY_ROUTE_PLANNING,
   and the citizens that are deliverers in the SYSTEM with their OWN_ROUTES to
   their destinations.  the proposed approach is supported by a MAS_FRAMEWORK
   for OPEN_FLEETS_MANAGEMENT. moreover, the executed tests suggest that the
   lmd by citizens can drastically reduce the emissions of CARBON_DIOXIDE and
   other AIRBORNE_POLLUTANTS that are caused by DELIVERY_TRUCKS. moreover it
   can reduce the TRAFFIC_CONGESTION and noise in URBAN_AREAS.

AB the literature on the impact of RISK_AVERSION on SUPPLY_CHAINS (scs) is
   relatively limited and, in particular, there is a dearth of THEORY and a
   lack of EMPIRICAL_EVIDENCE concerning: (1) the impact of
   INDIVIDUAL_RISK_AVERSION on the generation and DYNAMICS of the ORDER_POLICY
   (e.g.  ORDER_PATTERNS and INVENTORY holding COSTS); (2) the impact of
   several combinations of risk_averse members in each stage of a multi_echelon
   SC. we explore these gaps through a multi_method approach (I.e.
   HUMAN_EXPERIMENTS and agent_based SIMULATION), thus using both empirical and
   simulated data.  specifically, based on results from a HUMAN_EXPERIMENT, we
   develop the conjecture that RISK_AVERSION is positively correlated to the
   desired STOCK_LEVEL and consequently to the SAFETY_STOCK_FACTOR of
   INVENTORY_ORDER_POLICIES. building on this finding, we perform a
   SIMULATION_STUDY to infer the impact of INDIVIDUAL_RISK_AVERSION in a
   multi_echelon SC. results show that ALTERNATIVE_COMPOSITIONS of the SC in
   terms of RISK_AVERSION_LEVELS of the echelons significantly influence
   INVENTORY_HOLDINGS and SC_DYNAMICS. the STUDY_IMPLIES that a company facing
   problems of high INVENTORY days_on_hand should favour low_risk aversion

   COMPANIES tend towards the use of MULTIPLE_INFORMATION_SYSTEMS such as ERP,

   under CONTROL. SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT is the heart of the

   field of information and COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES (ict), with the aim of
   extracting, transferring, storing, PROCESSING and SHARING the
   NECESSARY_INFORMATION at every LOGISTICS_ACTIVITY. in addition, it is
   important to automatically communicate and share each OPERATION related to
   the LOGISTICS flows to the actors involved for a better COLLABORATION and
   INTEROPERABILITY_IMPROVEMENT in the SUPPLY_CHAIN. in this paper, we give an
   approach of the IOT_USE in the SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT to ensure the

AB SIMULATIONS help to understand and predict the behaviour of
   COMPLEX_PHENOMENAS, likewise distributed socio_technical systems or how
   STAKEHOLDERS_INTERACTS in COMPLEX_DOMAINS. SUCH_DOMAINS are normally based
   on networked based INTERACTION, where information, product and DECISION
   flows comes in to play, especially under the well_known SUPPLY_CHAINS
   structures.  although TOOLS exist to simulate SUPPLY_CHAINS, they do not
   adequately support MULTIPLE_STAKEHOLDERS to collaboratively create and
   explore a variety of decision_making scenarios.  hence, in order to provide
   a PRELIMINARY_UNDERSTANDING on how these INTERACTION_AFFECTS_STAKEHOLDERS
   decision_making, this RESEARCH presents an study, analysis and
   PROPOSAL_DEVELOPMENT of ROBUST_PLATFORM to collaboratively build and
   SIMULATE_COMMUNICATION among SUPPLY_CHAIN. since realistic SUPPLY_CHAIN
   behaviours are complex, a multi_agent approach was selected in order to
   represent SUCH_COMPLEXITIES in a standardised manner.  the platform provides
   AGENT_BEHAVIOURS for COMMON_AGENT_PATTERNS. it provides extension hotspots
   to implement more SPECIFIC_AGENT_BEHAVIOUR for EXPERT_USERS (that requires
   programming). therefore, as KEY_CONTRIBUTION, TECHNICAL_ASPECTS of the
   platform are presented, and also the role of multi_level
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_SCENARIO SIMULATION is discussed and analysed, especially under
   de context of digital SUPPLY_CHAIN transformation in the agri_food context.
   finally, we discuss lessons learned from EARLY_TESTS with the

AB the AGENT_PARADIGM has been used by several researchers to build several

   APPLICATIONS, cross_disciplinary COMMUNICATION to supply_chain MANAGEMENT to

   DEPLOYMENT_INFRASTRUCTURE, the implemented agent_based APPLICATIONS are
   generally based on MODELS for closed systems.  given that

AB as ESSENTIAL_CONSUMER_GOODS for DAILY_LIFE, AGRICULTURAL_PRODUCTS tend to go
   bad from the farm to the table.  therefore, people put forward higher
   requirements for the quality of AGRICULTURAL_PRODUCTS. how to manage and
   CONTROL the quality of AGRICULTURAL_PRODUCTS and to CONTROL the quality of
   AGRICULTURAL_PRODUCTS by CHAIN_TYPE are the cores of SCIENTIFIC_RESEARCH.
   the purpose of combining AGENT_TECHNOLOGY with
   AGRICULTURAL_PRODUCT_QUALITY_SAFETY_TRACEABILITY_SYSTEM was to establish the
   quality and SAFETY_TRACEABILITY_SYSTEM of AGRICULTURAL_PRODUCTS based on
   multi_agent in the study.  ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE, INTELLIGENT_CONTROL and
   INTELLIGENT_DETECTION_TECHNOLOGIES were used effectively in the SYSTEM. the
   framework of quality and SAFETY_TRACEABILITY_SYSTEM of AGRICULTURAL_PRODUCTS
   proposed in this study can be used to ANALYZE_MODULES in the quality of
   AGRICULTURAL_PRODUCTS. through a number of AGENT refining divisions of
   labor, the QUALITY_SAFETY EARLY_WARNING and SUPERVISION_CONTROL for the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN of AGRICULTURAL_PRODUCTS was carried out.  the
   PERFORMANCE_EVALUATION_SYSTEM of
   AGRICULTURAL_PRODUCT_QUALITY_SAFETY_TRACEABILITY_SYSTEM based on multi_agent
   was established, so as to provide a SYSTEMATIC_EVALUATION_BASIS for the
   quality SUPPLY of AGRICULTURAL_PRODUCTS.  2018_ios press and the authors.

AB this PAPER_ADDRESSES the impact of INVENTORY_ERRORS on the PERFORMANCE of
   arborescent SUPPLY_CHAINS, characterized by the BULLWHIP_EFFECT. the
   INVENTORY_RECORDS_INACCURACY is caused by a PERMANENT_SHRINKAGE.
   PERIODIC_INVENTORY_AUDITS are used to CONTROL the consequences of the
   INVENTORY_RECORDS_INACCURACY_PHENOMENON. DIFFERENT_LEVELS of SHRINKAGE and
   DIFFERENT_FREQUENCY of audits are considered in the analysis.  the
   PERFORMANCE of the arborescent SUPPLY_CHAIN is compared with the PERFORMANCE
   of a CLASSICAL_SERIAL SUPPLY_CHAIN in order to provide BENCHMARKING. data is
   obtained through multi_agent SIMULATION. results show that the impact of
   INVENTORY_RECORDS_INACCURACY on the BULLWHIP_EFFECT is higher in the
   arborescent SUPPLY_CHAIN: (1) the arborescent SUPPLY_CHAIN is more
   vulnerable to INVENTORY_SHRINKAGE than the serial SUPPLY_CHAIN, and (2) the
   adoption of PERIODIC_INVENTORY_AUDITS is more beneficial in terms of
   BULLWHIP_REDUCTION in the arborescent SUPPLY_CHAIN than the serial

AB STRATEGIC_DECISION_MAKING_PLAYS an IMPORTANT_ROLE in DISASTER_MANAGEMENT. in
   view of an imminent or already occurring event, e.g.  FLOOD, that has the
   potential to stress and threaten populated regions, humanitarian
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT is a place where STRATEGIC_DECISION_MAKING_PLAYS a
   MAJOR_ROLE. sensible or STRATEGIC_MEASURES have to be developed in order to
   MITIGATE_DAMAGES. STRATEGIC_MEASURES should take into account available and
   possibly distributed RESOURCES, e.g.  VEHICLES, storages and
   STREET_NETWORKS, and of course the type of measure against the background of
   PROTECTION_GOALS. finding good or SENSIBLE_MEASURES becomes a HARD_TASK if
   the menaced REGION_REFERS to a densely populated area, where the
   FUNCTIONALITY of STREET_NETWORK has a dynamic feature in terms of the
   EMERGENCE of blocked segments.  this task gets even harder if the protection
   of CERTAIN_CRITICAL_INFRASTRUCTURES also has to be considered.  our work
   proposes a framework of a DECISION_SUPPORT_SYSTEM that is based on the
   synergetic coupling of a CRITICAL_INFRASTRUCTURE and a
   TRAFFIC_SIMULATION_MODULE. by defining DIFFERENT_EVENT_SCENARIOS,
   DIFFERENT_SIMULATION_RUNS can be triggered beforehand and according to the
   DECISION_MAKER'S preferences, SENSIBLE_MEASURES in terms of type of
   RESOURCES and routes are stored and displayed to the DECISION_MAKER.

AB SUPPLY_CHAINS are increasingly becoming more complex, making COLLABORATION
   progressively difficult to establish and maintain.  it is imperative to
   understand not only the consequences, but also the drivers of effective and
   EFFICIENT_COLLABORATION. in this study, we attempt to show how varying
   levels of COLLABORATION_IMPACT_SERVICE_LEVEL and how CLOUD_COMPUTING fosters
   these levels of COLLABORATION. we introduce a framework detailing how
   CLOUD_COMPUTING impacts three levels of COLLABORATION: (1)
   INFORMATION_CENTRALISATION, (2) VENDOR_MANAGED_INVENTORY and
   CONTINUOUS_REPLENISHMENT_PROGRAMMES and (3) BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE (bi)
   COLLABORATIVE_PLANNING, FORECASTING and REPLENISHMENT. in addition, we use
   multi_agent_based SIMULATION to analyse how each level of COLLABORATION
   (enhanced through CLOUD_COMPUTING) IMPACTS_SERVICE_LEVEL as measured by
   FILL_RATE. obtained results show that CLOUD_COMPUTING can enhance all three
   levels of COLLABORATION. further, our results demonstrate that
   BI_COLLABORATIVE_PLANNING, FORECASTING and REPLENISHMENT have significantly
   greater SERVICE_LEVEL_BENEFITS in comparison to other COLLABORATION_LEVELS.

AB SUPPLIER_SELECTION is a very IMPORTANT_DECISION for an ENTERPRISE to realize
   a SUSTAINABLE_PRODUCTION. however, almost all works, which concerned the
   ENVIRONMENTAL_ISSUES, focused on the SUPPLIER_SELECTION or
   EVALUATION_METHODS, rather than an INCENTIVE_MECHANISM to urge the
   participants to improve their decisions to reduce the harm to the
   ENVIRONMENT. in this RESEARCH, not only the COMMERCIAL_FACTORS (price,
   quantity, and LEAD_TIME), but also the ENVIRONMENT_FACTORS (GREEN_FACTORS
   and CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS) of the SUPPLIERS are considered in order to
   reduce the harm to the ENVIRONMENT (the CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS and the use
   of the HARMFUL_MATERIALS). a PRODUCT_TRANSPORTATION_DISTANCE is proposed for
   a product to record the TRANSPORTATION_DISTANCE from the RAW_MATERIAL to be
   a FINAL_PRODUCT, and to be consumed by the consumers.  it is used to
   calculate the CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS during the WHOLE_PROCESSES of the

AB FORMAL_SEMANTICS provide PRECISE_SPECIFICATIONS of the expected behavior of
   ORGANIZATIONAL_MODEL based on multi_agent SYSTEM, allowing users to
   understand them and also modelers to reason about them and to prove their
   correctness.  a first step was described to provide a
   FORMAL_SPECIFICATION_FRAMEWORK among organization_centered multi_agent
   SYSTEM by using an existing rewriting LOGIC_LANGUAGE called MAUDE to
   translate ORGANIZATIONAL_MODELS, which allows addressing these issues.
   SUCH_FORMALIZATION provides ADDITIONAL_BENEFITS, such as enabling the
   SIMULATION of the SPECIFICATIONS or giving access to the MAUDE_TOOLKIT to
   reason about them.  in this paper, MAUDE was used to formally describe
   agent_group_role_based_organization SPECIFICATIONS. the proposed framework
   could, in fact, be used as is or with some extensions to describe other
   AGENT_ORGANIZATION_MODELS. actually, the results of precedent works [31,32]
   were synthesized with ADDITIONAL_EXTENSIONS related to the
   FORMAL_DESCRIPTION of the agent_group_role MODEL. this approach is

AB MANUFACTURING_SUSTAINABILITY is related to COMPLEX_ADAPTIVE_SYSTEMS crossing
   DIFFERENT_LAYERS; SUSTAINABILITY_ISSUES, and their POTENTIAL_RESOLUTIONS,
   are transversal to SUPPLY and shop_floor levels, often including INTERACTION
   between them; in addition, MULTIPLE_ACTORS across the SUPPLY_CHAIN_INTERACT
   displaying non_linear and non_rational behaviours characterized by feedbacks
   and TIME_LAGS. this COMPLEXITY is nowadays addressed with
   CLASSICAL_SIMULATION_APPROACHES such as SYSTEM_DYNAMICS (sd),
   DYNAMIC_SYSTEMS (ds) at very high and AGGREGATE_LEVEL, or
   DISCRETE_EVENT_SIMULATION (DES) at very low and disaggregated level.
   AGENT_BASED_MODELLING (abm) approach may potentially address SUCH_ISSUES in
   a more EFFECTIVE_WAY because it exploits the strengths of both aggregated
   and disaggregated MODELS, while minimizing the drawbacks.  the purpose of
   this paper is to present a self_developed multi_agent based framework as a
   basis for sustainable MANUFACTURING MODELLING, SIMULATION and analysis.  a
   LITERATURE_REVIEW on AGENT_BASED_MODELLING applied to sustainable
   MANUFACTURING issues is reported to justify choices adopted in the developed

AB schedules of SUPPLY_CHAINS are generated with buffers to absorb the effect
   of DISRUPTIVE_EVENTS that could occur during their execution.  schedules can
   be systematically repaired through SPECIFIC_MODIFICATIONS within buffers by
   using APPROPRIATE_DECISION_MODELS that consider the distributed nature of a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. to this aim, information of DISRUPTIVE_EVENTS at occurrence or
   in advance allows DECISION_MODELS to make better decisions.  to detect and
   predict DISRUPTIVE_EVENTS along a SCHEDULE_EXECUTION, a service_oriented
   MONITORING subsystem that uses a REFERENCE_MODEL for defining MONITORING
   MODELS was proposed.  this subsystem offers services for collecting
   EXECUTION_DATA of a SCHEDULE and ENVIRONMENT_DATA, and assessing them to
   detect/anticipate DISRUPTIVE_EVENTS. because of the distributed nature and
   the COMPLEXITY of these SERVICES_FUNCTIONALITIES, this paper presents an
   agent_based approach for their implementation.  this TECHNOLOGY allows
   dealing with SUPPLY_CHAIN MONITORING by structuring MONITORING
   SUBSYSTEM_FUNCTIONALITIES as a set of AUTONOMOUS_ENTITIES. these entities
   are able to perform tailored plans created at EXECUTION_TIME to concurrently
   monitor DIFFERENT_SCHEDULES. a CASE_STUDY is described to try out the

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN PLANNING and SCHEDULING_PROBLEMS require MANUFACTURERS
   (PROJECT_MANAGERS) to determine PRODUCT_CONFIGURATIONS, SELECT_SUPPLIERS
   (CONTRACTORS) for TASK_ALLOCATION, and SCHEDULE_PROJECT_TASKS while
   considering VARIOUS_PRODUCTION_CONSTRAINTS among MANUFACTURERS and
   SUPPLIERS. most RELEVANT_STUDIES have focused on finding an OPTIMAL_SOLUTION
   based on COMPLETE_INFORMATION provided by each ENTERPRISE in a SUPPLY_CHAIN.
   however, the PRACTICAL_IMPLEMENTATION of COMPLETE_INFORMATION SHARING is
   difficult, if not impossible, because of the fully distributed nature of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROCESS. this work proposes an agent_based FUZZY
   constraint_directed NEGOTIATION (afcn) MODEL to solve problems associated
   with SUPPLY_CHAIN PLANNING_AND_SCHEDULING, which are modeled as a set of
   FUZZY_CONSTRAINT_SATISFACTION_PROBLEMS (fcsps) that are interlinked via
   inter_agent constraints.  to accommodate the perspectives and interests of
   each ENTERPRISE in a SUPPLY_CHAIN, CONFLICTS among fcsps are resolved using
   the AFCN_PROTOCOL through the ITERATIVE_EXCHANGE of offers/counter_offers
   with limited INFORMATION_SHARING and without PRIVACY_BREACHES. a proposed
   offer/counter_offer represents not only a set of ACCEPTABLE_SOLUTIONS and
   preferences for an OPERATIONAL_TASK but also the possibility of CONFLICT in
   this area.  for each fcsp, the INCREMENTAL_PROCESS of offer/counter_offer
   EVALUATION eliminates redundant and INFEASIBLE_SOLUTIONS. the SHARING of
   limited non_strategic SENSITIVE_INFORMATION among AGENTS enables them to
   elucidate their OPPONENTS_INTENTIONS through ITERATIVE_NEGOTIATIONS, such
   that the AGENTS can reach an agreement while ensuring that the solution to a
   PROJECT_PLANNING and SCHEDULING_PROBLEM is satisfactory.  the AFCN_MODEL is
   also sufficiently flexible to incorporate DIFFERENT_NEGOTIATION_STRATEGIES

AB SUGAR_CANE_DISTRIBUTION_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEM is a CRITICAL_PROBLEM in
   tucuman, argentina, with geographical, environmental and
   ECONOMIC_CHARACTERISTICS that makes it different from SIMILAR_TRANSPORTATION
   or SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROBLEMS. motivated by this problem, we introduce in this
   paper a NEW_HEURISTIC_ALGORITHM to solve it.  the problem is represented as
   a non_linear variant of the generalized ASSIGNMENT_PROBLEM, and the
   ALGORITHM introduced is a BINARY_PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION implemented on
   a MULTIAGENT_SYSTEM, written in SARL_LANGUAGE. the NEW_ALGORITHM was tested
   on a previously developed BENCHMARK_SUITE, and it can efficiently solve the
   problem, finding the OPTIMAL_SOLUTION for all TEST_INSTANCES of
   DIFFERENT_TYPES.  copyright by the paper'S authors.

AB purpose: DECISION_SUPPORT_SYSTEMS are becoming an INDISPENSABLE_TOOL for
   managing complex SUPPLY_CHAINS. the purpose of this paper is to develop a
   multi_agent_based SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM that incorporates
   BIG_DATA_ANALYTICS that can exert AUTONOMOUS_CORRECTIVE_CONTROL_ACTIONS. the
   effects of the SYSTEM on SUPPLY_CHAIN AGILITY are explored.
   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/approach: for the DEVELOPMENT of the ARCHITECTURE of the
   SYSTEM, a SEQUENTIAL_APPROACH is adopted.  first three
   FUNDAMENTAL_DIMENSIONS of SUPPLY_CHAIN AGILITY are identified
   responsiveness, FLEXIBILITY and speed.  then the ORGANISATIONAL_DESIGN of
   the SYSTEM is developed.  the roles for each of the AGENTS within the
   framework are defined and the INTERACTIONS among these AGENTS are modelled.
   findings: APPLICATIONS of the MODEL are discussed, to show how the proposed
   MODEL can potentially provide enhanced levels in each of the dimensions of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN AGILITY. RESEARCH limitations/implications: the STUDY_SHOWS how
   the multi_agent systems can assist to overcome the trade_off between
   SUPPLY_CHAIN AGILITY and COMPLEXITY of global SUPPLY_CHAINS. it also opens
   up a NEW_RESEARCH_AGENDA for incorporation of BIG_DATA and
   SEMANTIC_WEB_APPLICATIONS for the DESIGN of SUPPLY_CHAIN
   INFORMATION_SYSTEMS. PRACTICAL_IMPLICATIONS: the proposed INFORMATION_SYSTEM
   provides integrated capabilities for PRODUCTION, SUPPLY_CHAIN event and
   DISRUPTION_RISK_MANAGEMENT under a COLLABORATIVE_BASIS. originality/value: a
   NOVEL_ASPECT in the DESIGN of multi_agent systems is introduced for

AB shortage of feedstock has hindered the DEVELOPMENT of CHINA'S
   BIOMASS_POWER_GENERATION because it is highly difficult to collect straw in
   CHINA. we pioneered a NEW_FEEDSTOCK SUPPLY MODEL in which the
   FORMAL_OFFICIAL_ORGANIZATION of villagers' committees is introduced.
   different from the PREVIOUS_FEEDSTOCK SUPPLY patterns, the
   IMMATERIAL_UTILITY of RELATIVE_STAKEHOLDERS and the impact of villagers'
   committees on farmers' behavior are considered in this paper.  to compare
   this pattern'S PERFORMANCE with that of the CONVENTIONAL_ONES, this paper
   developed a multi_agent MODEL specifically for CHINA'S situation.  we
   applied the MODEL to simulate the OPERATION of a BIOMASS SUPPLY_CHAIN. the
   results show that the proposed feedstock SUPPLY pattern can significantly
   increase the profits of BIOMASS_PLANTS, BIOMASS SUPPLY amounts, and farmers'
   participation, and in contrast with the BROKER_PATTERN, it can lower
   FEEDSTOCK_PRICES through disintermediation.  SENSITIVITY_ANALYSES show that
   preferential feed_in tariffs are still necessary for BIOMASS_POWER and that
   the NEW_PATTERN can ease the government'S subsidy burdens.  additionally,
   farmers' OPPORTUNITY_COSTS for supplying BIOMASS, their perceptions of
   IMMATERIAL_UTILITY and the cooperative'S FINANCIAL_RESOURCE_SCHEMES of the
   PUBLIC_WELFARE_FUND all have differing impacts on the achievement of the
   NEW_PATTERN.  2016 ELSEVIER_LTD

AB there is an increasing interest on developing VIRTUAL_ENTERPRISES in order
   to deal with the globalisation of the ECONOMY, the RAPID_GROWTH of
   INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGIES and the increase of COMPETITIVENESS. in this paper
   we deal with the DEVELOPMENT of normative OPEN_VIRTUAL_ENTERPRISES (noves).
   they are systems with a GLOBAL_OBJECTIVE that are composed of a set of
   HETEROGENEOUS_ENTITIES and ENTERPRISES that EXCHANGE_SERVICES following a
   SPECIFIC_NORMATIVE_CONTEXT. in order to analyse and DESIGN_SYSTEMS of this
   kind the multi_agent paradigm seems suitable because it offers a
   SPECIFIC_SOLUTION for supporting the social and CONTRACTUAL_RELATIONSHIPS
   between ENTERPRISES and for formalising their BUSINESS_PROCESSES. this paper
   presents how the regulated open multi_agent systems (romas) METHODOLOGY, an
   agent_oriented SOFTWARE_METHODOLOGY, can be used to analyse and
   DESIGN_NOVES. romas offers a COMPLETE_DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS that allows
   identifying and formalising of the structure of noves, their
   NORMATIVE_CONTEXT and the INTERACTIONS among their members.  the use of
   romas is exemplified by means of a CASE_STUDY that represents an automotive
   SUPPLY_CHAIN.  2015 taylor & francis.

AB SUPPLIER_SELECTION is an IMPORTANT_TASK in PURCHASING. the PERFORMANCE of a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN depends on the selection of the RIGHT_SUPPLIERS to provide the
   RIGHT_MATERIALS or services at the RIGHT_PRICE and RIGHT_TIME. most of the
   RESEARCH on SUPPLIER_EVALUATION and SELECTION_ASSUMES that products are
   procured independently.  however, in reality, it is common for a PURCHASING
   company to procure a bundle of products together.  in this regard, synergy
   could exist between products and hence affect the FINAL_CHOICE of SUPPLIERS.
   it is therefore necessary for the PURCHASING company to incorporate the
   SYNERGY_BETWEEN_PRODUCTS in SUPPLIER_SELECTION. this paper presents a
   multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) ARCHITECTURE for multi_product SUPPLIER_SELECTION
   in consideration of the SYNERGY_BETWEEN_PRODUCTS. a three_phase
   SUPPLIER_SELECTION MODEL is proposed to support multi_product PROCUREMENT in
   consideration of the SYNERGY_BETWEEN_PRODUCTS. the three phases are, namely,
   PRODUCT_SYNERGY_DETERMINATION_PHASE, supplier pre_selection phase and
   negotiation_based FINAL_SELECTION_PHASE. the MAS is equipped with
   VARIOUS_TYPES of AUTONOMOUS_FUNCTION_AGENTS and
   DIFFERENT_AGENT_INTERACTION_PROTOCOLS to effect the functioning of this
   three_phase multi_product SUPPLIER_SELECTION MODEL.  2015 taylor & francis.

AB due to the steadily increasing FREIGHT_RATES it is being searched in
   LOGISTICS for decades for methods to organize transports and their
   COMMUNICATION within the framework of INTERNATIONAL_FREIGHT_TRAFFICS more
   efficiently and sustainably.  an idea emerging consistently in this context
   is the more EFFICIENT_CONFIGURATION and COORDINATION of
   MULTIMODAL_TRANSPORT_CHAINS whereby freights are being transported by
   utilization of DIFFERENT_TRANSPORT_CARRIERS like e.g.  ship, rail and road.
   through a better intercommunication of the actors involved in a TRANSPORT,
   also across DIFFERENT_TRANSPORT_CARRIERS, environmentally HARMFUL_EMISSIONS
   shall be reduced in the midterm, the COSTS on LONG_DISTANCES shall be
   lowered and INFORMATION_ASYMMETRIES in single TRANSPORT_MARKETS shall be
   mitigated.  different future_ and innovation_oriented projects, like e.g.
   logfor, code24 and CENTRAL_EUROPE, make efforts to achieve
   MEASURABLE_PROGRESS in this area.  within the framework of the
   CODE24_PROJECT the PROTOTYPE_ORFE of an ONLINE_RAIL_FREIGHT_EXCHANGE has
   been developed at the institute for PRODUCTION and
   INDUSTRIAL_INFORMATION_MANAGEMENT of the university of duisburg_essen.  it
   DEMONSTRATES_FUNCTIONALITIES for a more TRANSPARENT_COMMUNICATION of
   AVAILABLE_TRANSPORT_SERVICES and also supports the CONFIGURATION of
   multimodal SUPPLY_CHAINS. the POSITIVE_FEEDBACK within and outside of the
   PROJECT_SHOWS the ACTUAL_DEMAND for an ONLINE_SUPPORT of the
   SERVICE_PROCESSES within the RAIL_FREIGHT_INDUSTRY. for instance, the
   establishment of the first dedicated ONLINE_RAIL_FREIGHT_EXCHANGES in the
   year 2013 trace directly back to the efforts of the PROJECT_PARTNERS within
   the CODE24_PROJECT. while it remains to be seen whether the hereby
   established products can permanently prove themselves on the MARKET, the
   presented PAPER_ARGUES that SUCH_ONLINE_MARKETPLACES will be replaced by
   such with more INNOVATIVE_APPROACHES in the LONG_RUN. for though the
   described concept of an ONLINE_FREIGHT_EXCHANGE can reduce the
   non_transparency of single TRANSPORT_MARKETS as well as the COSTS in case of
   SUFFICIENT_PARTICIPATION, ITS way of communicating TRANSPORT_SERVICES
   carries other problems: the PURE_CONTACTUAL_MEDIATION between
   POTENTIAL_BUSINESS_PARTNERS requires a HIGH_CONFIDENCE in the communicating
   institution and cannot, even in case of BELIEVABLE_NEUTRALITY of the
   MARKETPLACE_OPERATOR, guarantee contractually binding BUSINESS_TRANSACTIONS
   as these have to take place outside of the ONLINE_FREIGHT_EXCHANGE after the
   CONTACT_INITIATION. from the point of view of the authors, these
   CONTACT_EXCHANGES will be replaced by agent_based FREIGHT_EXCHANGES in the
   LONG_RUN. such an afex_system (agent_based FREIGHT_EXCHANGE) will provide a
   highly automatized and interconnected marketplace which provides the
   possibility for DECENTRALIZED and AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS to conclude
   independently a contract that is optimal for them in a completely
   TRANSPARENT_MARKET_ACTIVITY from their point of view.  the contractual
   binding AUCTION of MULTIMODAL_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT_SERVICES is made possible
   through the application of a two_sided COMBINATORIAL_AUCTION_MODEL which
   allows the AUCTION_PARTICIPANTS to submit offers and demands for
   combinations of TRANSPORT_SERVICES that shall be realized by means of
   DIFFERENT_TRANSPORT_CARRIERS. the paper at HAND_COMPARES the PAST_RESEARCH
   and DEVELOPMENTAL_RESULTS on ONLINE_MARKETPLACES for the COMMUNICATION of
   AVAILABLE_TRANSPORT_SERVICES like orfe with the CONCEPTUAL_BASES as well as
   chosen PROTOTYPICAL_CHARACTERISTICS of the sketched afex_system.  finally,
   an outlook on prospective, INNOVATIVE_CONCEPTS will be given which support
   the NEGOTIATION of CONTRACTS for MULTIMODAL_TRANSPORT_SERVICES with
   multi_agent systems.  2016, springer international publishing switzerland.

AB the production_distribution PLANNING is one of the most IMPORTANT_APPROACHES
   to support GLOBAL_OPTIMISATION in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM), and should
   be solved within the INTEGRATED_STRUCTURE. the production_distribution
   PLANNING_PROBLEM (pdpp) involves the determination of the best CONFIGURATION
   regarding LOCATION, size, TECHNOLOGY_CONTENT and PRODUCT_RANGE to achieve
   the firm'S long_term GOALS. on the other hand, teams of AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS
   (ATEAMS), cooperating by SHARING SOLUTIONS through a COMMON_MEMORY, have
   been proposed as a means of solving COMBINATORIAL_OPTIMISATION_PROBLEMS. in
   this paper a HYBRID_SEARCH_APPROACH is presented using an agent_based SYSTEM
   by considering ATEAMS_CONCEPT for solving the pdpp.  for this purpose, three
   ALGORITHMS are provided to solve the pdpp: GENETIC_ALGORITHM (GA),
   TABU_SEARCH (ts) and SIMULATED_ANNEALING (sa). then we combine these
   ALGORITHMS using a multi_agent SYSTEM and an integrated SOLUTION_ALGORITHM
   is proposed.  finally, the proposed approach is compared against
   LINGO_SOFTWARE. the obtained results reveal that the use of multi_agent
   SYSTEM delivers better SOLUTIONS to us.  copyright  2017

AB in this paper, we investigate the issues of establishing ADAPTIVE_FEEDBACKS
   between COMPLEX_SYSTEMS (css) SCHEDULING and execution from the perspectives
   of MODERN_CONTROL_THEORY. in using OPTIMUM_CONTROL for the SCHEDULING_STAGE,
   FEEDBACK_ADAPTIVE_CONTROL for the EXECUTION_STAGE, and attainable sets for
   the analysis of the achievement of the planned PERFORMANCE in a
   REAL_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT, we provide a mathematically unified framework
   for CSS_SCHEDULING and EXECUTION_CONTROL. the proposed framework makes it
   possible to analyze the correspondence of RFID
   (RADIO_FREQUENCY_IDENTIFICATION) functionalities and COSTS to the
   ACTUAL_NEEDS of EXECUTION_CONTROL and support problem_oriented
   CSS_ADAPTATION for the achievement of the desired PERFORMANCE. the developed
   framework can be applied as an ANALYSIS_TOOL for the DECISION_SUPPORT
   regarding the designing and applying RFID_INFRASTRUCTURES in SUPPLY_CHAINS.

AB inter_organizational COLLABORATIVE_SIMULATION requires covering the
   KNOWLEDGE of AGENT, flow and PROCESS to qualifiedly represent the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK_OPERATION. this paper proposes a multi_methodological
   COLLABORATIVE SIMULATION_FRAMEWORK for inter_organizational
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS. this FRAMEWORK_INTEGRATES the agent_based,
   flow_centric and process_oriented methodologies.  this FRAMEWORK_ESTABLISHES
   a COLLABORATIVE_KNOWLEDGE_REPRESENTATION_APPROACH for SIMULATION_MODELING.
   in the approach, a multi_agent SYSTEM is adopted to represent the
   inter_organizational structure of a SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK; the three flows of
   material, information and time are enabled to represent the
   OPERATIONAL_MECHANISMS; and the processes are used to represent the
   MICRO_BEHAVIORS of AGENTS. this APPROACH_INTEGRATES the KNOWLEDGE of AGENT
   and PROCESS with that of flow and solves the problems regarding the
   INTEGRATION of the agent_based, flow_centric and process_oriented
   methodologies.  to implement the inter_organizational
   COLLABORATIVE_SIMULATION, a COLLABORATIVE_FRAMEWORK is proposed.  this
   FRAMEWORK_INTEGRATES MULTIPLE_SIMULATION_FORMALISMS, such as
   TIME_SERIES_INCREMENTS, EVENT_SCHEDULING, POLICY_CONTROL,
   PROCESS_INTERACTION and activity scanning; it promotes the unification of
   the three DIFFERENT_METHODOLOGIES. a case of a five_level MANUFACTURING
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK is studied using the proposed framework.  the findings
   indicate that the proposed framework is particularly qualified in the
   KNOWLEDGE_REPRESENTATION of a SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK and is effective in
   implementing the inter_organizational COLLABORATIVE_SIMULATION in a
   DECENTRALIZED manner; in addition, it is well contributive to

AB concentrations of population and ECONOMIC_ACTIVITIES in URBAN_AREAS have
   been growing for the last decades.  further trend is the increasing share of
   e_commerce activities of PRIVATE_HOUSEHOLDS. this results in a higher share
   of flexible and more small_scaled deliveries.  consequently, an increased
   share of trips of small and medium sized FREIGHT_VEHICLES has been observed
   and is expected in URBAN_AREAS. these DEVELOPMENT_DRIVERS of

   vulnerabilities in SUPPLY_CHAINS, EFFECTIVE_MATHEMATICAL_TOOLS for analysing
   and understanding appropriate SUPPLY_CHAIN risk EVALUATION are now
   attracting more attention.  administration of a successful SUPPLY_CHAIN
   depends on how efficiently of the NETWORK_DESIGN is measured and how

   to DESIGN a MULTI_AGENT SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK that addresses an
   UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENT threatened by DIFFERENT_RISK_SOURCES in order to
   capture the REAL_WORLD_CONDITIONS; the second one is to present a
   METHODOLOGY for estimating risk in the proposed network.  MOREOVER_TREE of

   how to SCHEDULE_ACTIVITIES to meet the CONSTRUCTION_PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS
   under RESOURCE_CONSTRAINTS is an IMPORTANT_ISSUE. to create a
   FEASIBLE_SCHEDULE for a CONSTRUCTION_PROJECT, COMPANIES in a

AB CONSUMER_DEMAND for regionally_produced food has increased dramatically in
   the PAST_DECADE, in response to concerns over FOOD_SAFETY and quality, as
   well as the SERIOUS_ENVIRONMENTAL, economic, and SOCIAL_EQUITY_ISSUES that
   pervade the MODERN_INDUSTRIAL_FOOD SUPPLY SYSTEM. as DEMAND grows,
   DISTRIBUTORS of regionally_produced food (I.e., FOOD_HUBS) face many
   challenges in their efforts to scale up, particularly with
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. they must find ways to operate more efficiently
   without undermining their support for the regional farming community.  in
   this paper we describe a multi_agent SIMULATION_MODEL of a theoretical
   REGIONAL_FOOD_SYSTEM in which MULTIPLE_FARMERAGENTS produce food, negotiate
   with a regional food_hub_agent, and try to sell their food at the best
   POSSIBLE_PRICE. using this MODEL, we compare the effects of
   VARIOUS_FOOD_HUB_SUPPLIER_SELECTION_POLICIES on SYSTEM_OUTCOMES, in terms of
   FOOD_HUB_PROFITABILITY, the COST of quality, TRANSACTION_COSTS, the number
   of farmers required to satisfy DEMAND, and the SIZE_DISTRIBUTION of these
   farmers.  results suggest that the food hub'S selection POLICY significantly
   impacts long_term SYSTEM_PERFORMANCE.

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM) is a kind of MANAGEMENT thought and method to
   ENHANCE_ENTERPRISE_COMPETITIVENESS widely valued by INTERNATIONAL_ACADEMIA
   and BUSINESS_CIRCLES at present.  AGENT has the characteristics of AUTONOMY,
   INTERACTION, initiative and reactiveness, which is more suitable for
   developing the SCM_SYSTEM than TRADITIONAL_SOFTWARE_METHODS. on the basis of
   the RESEARCH on the CONCEPTUAL_FRAMEWORK and OPERATIONAL_REFERENCE_MODEL of
   SCM, four steps to CONSTRUCT_SCM_SYSTEM_MODEL was proposed: the analysis of
   entities in SCM; the confirmation of PROCESSING_FLOW; the DESIGN of
   BUSINESS_PROCESS_AGENT and BUSINESS_PROCESS_UNIT_FRAMEWORK; and the proposal
   of multi_agent SCM_SYSTEM MODEL and task_based MAS_MODEL. in this paper,

   CLASSICAL_COMPUTING technologies have shown little success in MODELING
   COMPLEX_SYSTEMS. however, a LARGE_BODY of RESEARCH in multi_agent SYSTEM
   (MAS) TECHNOLOGY has demonstrated how COMPLEX_SYSTEMS can be modeled to
   GENERATE_SMART_SOLUTIONS, which could not be done otherwise.  we have
   researched on the DESIGN and DEVELOPMENT of MAS for SCM. in this solution,
   each phase in the SUPPLY_CHAIN has been developed as an AGENT enabling
   COMMUNICATION, COORDINATION and NEGOTIATION among the AGENTS to achieve
   intended BUSINESS_GOALS. the study investigated DECENTRALIZED

   using a JAVA_AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK (JADE) and consist of

AB in this work, we propose a sequential distributed MPC_ALGORITHM for CONTROL
   of a linear SUPPLY_CHAIN. the ALGORITHM is developed by closely taking into
   account SUPPLY_CHAIN specifics and requirements from practice, e.g., orders
   and leavings are both treated as DECISION_VARIABLES at each stage and
   COMMUNICATION between stages is kept low.  we present the rather
   SURPRISING_RESULT that TERMINAL_EQUALITY_CONSTRAINTS employed in the
   LOCAL_MPC_FORMULATIONS are inherently satisfied for the OVERALL_SYSTEM,
   despite the presence of BILATERAL_DYNAMIC_COUPLINGS and solving the
   LOCAL_MPC_PROBLEMS sequentially.  this is due to the stock and FLOW_NATURE
   of the problem.  the proposed ALGORITHM is shown to be recursively feasible,
   to asymptotically satisfy a CONSTANT_CUSTOMER_DEMAND and to achieve
   ASYMPTOTIC_CONVERGENCE of the LOCAL_STOCK and backlog to the desired levels.
   this is illustrated by NUMERICAL_SIMULATIONS.  2017

AB the OBJECTIVE of this paper is to come up with a concept of
   DYNAMIC_RESILIENCE MODELLING for the COMPLEX_LOGISTIC_SYSTEMS, and
   especially the global SUPPLY_NETWORKS. the CORE_IDEA of the OVERALL_CONCEPT
   is based on the experiences gained in the area of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_RISK_MANAGEMENT (waters, 2007), the SERVICE_ENGINEERING
   (salvendy & karwowski, 2010), the RISK_ENGINEERING (aven, baraldi, flage &

   (hollnagel, woods & leveson., 2006). based on the assumptions of samsons
   unified servicetheory (sampson, 2010), we propose a GENERAL_MODEL of a
   COMPLEX_LOGISTICS_SYSTEM, consisting of two parts representing both the
   inward and the OUTWARD_LOGISTICS. in the first part of the MODEL there are
   mapped UPSTREAM_OPERATIONS, related to SUPPLY of the FOCUS_ORGANIZATION in
   RAW_MATERIALS, necessary to carry out the PRODUCTION. the second part of the
   MODEL includes downstream OPERATIONS and also processes corresponding to the
   DISTRIBUTION of products to the first_tier and second_tier CUSTOMERS.  2017

AB abstract in the present, global and COMPETITIVE_MARKET customer'S demands
   are very volatile.  it is very difficult for small and
   MEDIUM_SIZE_ENTERPRISES (SMES) to satisfy their customer with
   QUALITY_PRODUCT in REASONABLE_PRICE. LARGE_FIRMS are spending HUGE_AMOUNT of
   their budget in generating TECHNOLOGY_DEVELOPMENT. to cope with this
   COMPETITIVE_MARKET, usually, SMES concentrate on their CORE_EXPERTISE and
   outsource some non_core items or activities.  the OUTSOURCING DECISION
   (when, what, whom) is very crucial for small_scale industries.  realizing
   this scenario, in this ARTICLE, an automated self_adaptive multi_agent
   SYSTEM has been proposed.  the proposed SYSTEM will help SMES to take an
   APPROPRIATE_DECISION to mitigate the UNCERTAINTY in SUPPLY_CHAIN. the
   developed SYSTEM_EXPLOITS the "OUTSOURCING of OPERATIONS" feature by ITS
   AGENTS to conclude the MANUFACTURING_PROCESSES faster and reduce the
   IDLE_TIME of CERTAIN_MACHINES with less HUMAN_INTERVENTION. the
   COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL for AGENTS has been described to give an insight of
   their COMMUNICATION. it was explained how VARIOUS_AGENTS like OUTSOURCING,
   MATERIAL_PLANNING and SUPPLIER_SELECTION will come into action at
   DIFFERENT_STAGES and take appropriate OUTSOURCING decisions.  therefore,
   this multi_agent ARCHITECTURE will facilitate SMALL_SCALE
   MANUFACTURING_INDUSTRIES to execute their MANUFACTURING_PROCESSES and
   COMPLEX_LOGISTICS_ISSUES efficiently.  the execution of proposed
   ARCHITECTURE has been described in the simulated CASE_STUDY.  2015

AB NATURAL_HAZARDS cause much damage to lives, assets, and the ECONOMY as a
   whole.  the FUNCTIONAL_DISCONTINUITY of businesses impacted by a
   NATURAL_DISASTER has a DIRECT_IMPACT on affected community'S quality of
   live.  in regional and REMOTE_COMMUNITIES_PETROLEUM FUELS are an
   ESSENTIAL_COMMODITY, particularly in post_disaster situations, given the
   SUPPLY_CHAINS of many other commodities are dependent on fuel SUPPLY. the
   aim of this study was to develop a framework and use it to ANALYSE_PETROLEUM
   SUPPLY to communities affected by FLOODING across queensland, australia.
   the intent was to assist INDUSTRY_PARTNERS in identifying
   VULNERABLE_LOCALITIES and to DEVELOPMENT_METHODS for application to other
   commodities.  the approach focused on both the DEMAND and SUPPLY side and
   used socio_spatial datasets, TRANSPORT and COMMODITY_DATA. a multi_agent
   MODEL was developed to represent the situation of PETROLEUM_FUEL
   SUPPLY_CHAIN before and after a DISASTER_EVENT. the RESULTS_IDENTIFY both
   the BROAD_SWEEP of VULNERABLE_LOCATIONS in KEY_REGIONS in queensland as well
   as PARTICULAR_ISSUES for communities in CAPE_YORK in far north queensland.
   the approach proved viable, despite the limitations of publically
   AVAILABLE_COMMODITY_DATASETS in australia, and should therefore be of
   assistance to POLICY_MAKERS elsewhere seeking to
   IDENTIFY_SYSTEM_VULNERABILITIES and INCREASE_RESILIENCE.  2017 the

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM) is a very CHALLENGING_PROBLEM that us
   leveraging the e_commerce explosion.  today'S SUPPLY_CHAINS are essentially
   static, because they rely on long_term relationship among key
   TRADING_PARTNERS. DYNAMIC_PRACTICES are vital because they offer better
   matches between SUPPLIERS and CUSTOMERS as MARKET_CONDITIONS change.
   multi_agent systems (MAS) offer NEW_PERSPECTIVES compared to conventional,
   centrally organized architectures in the scope of SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT
   (SCM). their structure inherently meets the requirements of DECENTRALIZED
   SUPPLY_CHAINS, whereas CONVENTIONAL_SCM_SYSTEMS are often restricted in
   terms of DYNAMIC_BEHAVIOR, handling SEVERE_DISTURBANCES at SUPPLIER_SITES as
   well as dealing with highly customized or COMPLEX_PRODUCTS. since
   NECESSARY_DATA are not available within the whole SUPPLY_CHAIN, an
   INTEGRATED_APPROACH to PRODUCTION_PLANNING and CONTROL taking into account
   all the partners involved is not feasible.  in this paper a MAS_ARCHITECTURE
   integrating VARIOUS_INTELLIGENT_AGENT_SYSTEMS is presented to address the

AB CLOUD_SERVICE_COMPOSITION is required when single CLOUD_SERVICE cannot
   satisfy all requirements of the user.  CLOUD_SERVICE_COMPOSITION presents an
   EFFICIENT_MANAGERIAL, on_demand and SCALABLE_WAY to integrate
   COMPUTATIONAL_RESOURCES (HARDWARE, platform, and software). it includes
   several tasks such as discovery, selection, and deployment of the services.
   in this paper, an AGENT based approach for CLOUD_SERVICE_NEGOTIATION is
   proposed.  AGENT based TECHNOLOGY has hailed as a NEW_PARADIGM for
   implementing SOFTWARE_AGENTS. SOFTWARE_AGENTS are AUTONOMOUS_ENTITIES which
   act on behalf of user across open and DISTRIBUTED_ENVIRONMENTS. a
   MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM for CLOUD_SERVICE_COMPOSITION makes use of a
   market_oriented approach which would regulate DEMAND and SUPPLY_CHAIN. this
   WORK_INVOLVES creating SERVICE_PROVIDER_AGENTS and CONSUMER_AGENTS. the
   RESOURCES offered by the SERVICE_PROVIDERS are created as VIRTUAL_MACHINES
   in cloud that would be mapped to the consumers.  the CONSUMER_AGENT gets the
   input from the user and finds the best SERVICE_PROVIDERS who satisfy the
   consumer'S constraints.  CONSUMER_AGENT further establishes a NEGOTIATION
   between these SERVICE_PROVIDERS and purchases the CLOUD_SERVICES for MARKET
   FAVORABLE_COST. the consumer and SERVICE_PROVIDER_AGENTS_COMMUNICATE using
   CONTRACT_NET_PROTOCOL, which is a task_sharing PROTOCOL in multi_agent
   SYSTEM. the WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE of this FRAMEWORK_INVOLVES_INTERACTION and
   NEGOTIATION of the consumer and SERVICE_PROVIDER_AGENTS. also, a
   MATHEMATICAL_MODEL has been proposed to support market_driven approach in

   RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT and WELL_SCHEDULING (RESOURCE_SCHEDULING, for short).
   however, RESOURCE_SCHEDULING has been a challenge for oil and GAS_COMPANIES
   for many years because it is influenced by a number of factors including
   ENVIRONMENT, regulations, STAKEHOLDERS, finances, the MARKET, and approaches
   to determine and plan daily SCHEDULABLE_TASKS this paper proposes a
   NEW_APPROACH to MODELING well SCHEDULING_PROCESSES in oil and GAS_INDUSTRY
   using the notion of VIRTUAL_ENTERPRISE with INTELLIGENT_AGENTS and
   CONTRACT_NET_PROTOCOL in MULTIAGENT_SYSTEMS_TECHNOLOGIES. this MODEL will
   LEAD to a flexible well SCHEDULING_APPLICATION that will assist in the
   SCHEDULING of RESOURCES across the well lifecycle.  we show the
   effectiveness of the approach by implementing an EXPERIMENTAL_SYSTEM and
   giving a CASE_STUDY.  2014 ieee.

AB to increase PROFITABILITY, farmers often decide to form
   STRATEGIC_PARTNERSHIPS with other farmers, pooling their RESOURCES and
   OUTPUTS for greater EFFICIENCY and scale.  these COORDINATION_DECISIONS can
   have far_reaching and COMPLEX_IMPLICATIONS for OVERALL_FOOD SUPPLY_CHAIN
   structural EMERGENCE, which in TURN_IMPACTS_SYSTEM_OUTCOMES and long_term
   SUSTAINABILITY. in this paper, we describe an agent_based MODEL that
   explores the impacts of FARMER_COORDINATION_DECISIONS on the DEVELOPMENT of
   food SUPPLY_CHAIN_STRUCTURE over time.  this MODEL_FOCUSES on one type of
   COORDINATION_MECHANISM_IMPLEMENTATION_METHOD, in which coordinated
   FARMER_GROUPS produce a single CROP_TYPE and combine their yields to achieve
   economies of scale.  the FARMER_AGENTS' decisions to coordinate with one
   another depend on their EVALUATION of the tradeoff between their AUTONOMY
   and the expected ECONOMIC_BENEFITS of COORDINATION. each
   COORDINATION_DECISION is a BILATERAL_PROCESS in which the terms of
   GROUP_REWARD SHARING are negotiated.  we capture the effects of farmers'
   size, income, and AUTONOMY_PREMIA, as well as volume_price relationships and
   group profit_sharing RULES, on the rate of FARMER_COORDINATION and the
   number and size of groups that form.  results indicate that under many
   conditions, COORDINATION_GROUPS tend to consolidate over time, which
   SUGGESTS_IMPLICATIONS for overall SUPPLY_CHAIN structural RESILIENCE.

AB in the DECLINE_PHASE of PRODUCT_LIFECYCLE, INDUSTRIALS_NEED to re_design
   their products to introduce new FUNCTIONS and/or CUSTOMERS' NEW_PREFERENCES.
   these changes may not only affect the product'S bill of material, but also
   ITS SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK. consequently, new SUPPLY_CHAIN COSTS are
   generated.  this PAPER_ADDRESSES the problem of SUPPLY_CHAIN CONFIGURATION
   considering new product re_design using a multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS). the
   OBJECTIVE of the SYSTEM is to ENSURE_GOOD_COLLABORATION between two
   DIFFERENT_POINTS of view, SUPPLY_CHAIN partners and PRODUCT_DESIGNERS, to
   make better decisions.  to MODEL the proposed SYSTEM, we select the
   multi_agent SYSTEM_ENGINEERING (mase) METHODOLOGY. the
   MAS_FRAMEWORK_CONTAINS three types of AGENTS, namely, \PRODUCT_DESIGN AGENT"
   and \SUPPLY_CHAIN AGENTS" which are fitted with OPTIMIZATION_TOOLS. these
   TOOLS allow COSTS' OPTIMIZATION and selection of SUPPLY_CHAIN means
   (SUPPLIERS, technologies, etc.). finally, the SYSTEM_CONTAINS a
   \COMMUNICATION AGENT" acting like a mediator; it FACILITATES_DATA_EXCHANGE
   between designers.  to support distributed decision_making, two MODELS of
   mixed INTEGER_LINEAR programming are adopted and implemented within the
   framework for SUPPLY_CHAIN_OPTIMIZATION. the OVERALL_MAS_APPROACH was tested
   in SIMULATION with a CASE_STUDY. the OBJECTIVE of the SIMULATION is to
   choose among three PRODUCT_ALTERNATIVES the cheapest one based on ITS
   supplying and PRODUCTION_COSTS, under CAPACITY_CONSTRAINTS. the MAS was able
   to find the best product alternative among three alternatives proposed by
   PRODUCT_DESIGN_TEAM and SELECT_OPTIMAL SUPPLY_CHAIN means.  the optimal
   SUPPLY_CHAIN contains two SUPPLIERS: one machine and one subcontractor to

   PAPER_AIMS to study how to achieve AGILITY in sustainable SUPPLY_CHAINS by

AB SUPPLIER_SELECTION is an IMPORTANT_PROBLEM in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. in
   practice, it is common for a PURCHASING company to procure a bundle of
   products simultaneously.  in this regard, SYNERGY_EFFECT could exist between
   products and hence affect the FINAL_CHOICE of SUPPLIERS. it is therefore
   necessary to incorporate the SYNERGY_EFFECT between products in
   SUPPLIER_SELECTION_PROCESS. agent_based NEGOTIATION_MODELS are applied to
   AUTOMATE_SUPPLIER_SELECTION_PROCESS. NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL is an
   ESSENTIAL_COMPONENT should be considered when building an
   EFFECTIVE_AGENT_NEGOTIATION_MODEL. the OBJECTIVE of this RESEARCH is to
   propose a NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL special for multi_product SUPPLIER_SELECTION
   problem.  the NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL is a HYBRID multi_agent PROTOCOL of
   COMBINATORIAL_PROCUREMENT_AUCTION_PROTOCOL and multi_bilateral BARGAINING
   PROTOCOL. the NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL is able to support the PURCHASING company
   and SUPPLIERS negotiate on the CONCRETE_COMMITMENTS of MULTIPLE_PRODUCTS
   simultaneously, and SELECT_SUPPLIERS for MULTIPLE_PRODUCTS. in addition,
   both the PURCHASING company and SUPPLIERS can express their preferences on
   the SYNERGY_EFFECT between products in NEGOTIATION_PROCESS by adopting the
   NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL. SIMULATION is conducted to demonstrate the
   effectiveness and EFFICIENCY of the NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL.  2016 INFORMA_UK

   COST_COLLABORATIVE_MANAGEMENT (ccm) of SUPPLY_CHAINS. we propose a
   NEW_SYSTEM that integrates multi_agents, context_aware computing, and
   context_aware reasoning to improve ccm in SUPPLY_CHAINS. the
   MAIN_CONCLUSIONS of our study indicate that these concepts, methods, and
   MECHANISMS such as context_aware computing and context_aware reasoning can
   be used to create a framework for designing self_adaptive mas_ccm systems,
   enhance the COORDINATION and INTERACTION of the SYSTEM with the
   EXTERNAL_ENVIRONMENT, and strengthen the capability of the SYSTEM for
   self_learning and self_adaptation.  and we use a CASE_STUDY to confirm that
   ENVIRONMENTAL_UNCERTAINTY can be automatically reduced to a win_win mode
   demonstrating the self_adaptive property of the amas_ccm SYSTEM through a
   context_aware DATABASE, and COLLABORATIVE_CAPABILITIES can solve

   AMONGST_AGENTS. based on this notion we build a COMPLETE_MULTIAGENT
   programming language and SYSTEM for explicitly representing, applying and

AB targeting the GREAT_UNCERTAINTY of the PROCESS_LEAD_TIME in the
   international SUPPLY and DISTRIBUTION_NETWORKS, the paper proposed a
   COORDINATION_FRAMEWORK of mixed multi_agent POLICIES between the QUAY_SYSTEM
   and SUPPLY_CHAINS, and built a LOOP_OPTIMIZATION decision_making MODEL based
   on the TACTICAL_LEAD_TIME. according to the DIFFERENT_REQUIREMENTS for the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_RESPONSIVENESS, SUITABLE_POLICIES were chosen to CONTROL the
   mean FLOW_TIME of the QUAY_FRONT operating SYSTEM in an international
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NODE, to regulate the LEAD_TIME_FLUCTUATION of the
   international SUPPLY_CHAINS, and to drive the GOAL_OPTIMIZATION of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE between time and COST. the RESEARCH adopted a
   combination of multi_objective OPTIMIZATION GENETIC_ALGORITHM and
   NEURAL_NETWORK and used an example of simulating the
   PLANNING_DECISION_PROCESS of SUPPLY_CHAIN oriented POLICIES adopted by a
   CONTAINER_QUAY. the results demonstrated that the proposed POLICIES could
   enhance the synergy effects between the QUAY_TACTICAL_PLANNING and the GOALS
   of time_sensitive SUPPLY_CHAINS. although more OPERATIONAL_EQUILIBRIUM_COST
   was needed to regulate the LEAD_TIME_FLUCTUATION, the obtained certainties
   of the TIME_GOAL can evidently improve the OVERALL_PERFORMANCE of the

AB POWER_CONVERSION for SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_PRODUCTION and DISTRIBUTION is one
   of the most ACTIVE_AREAS, since EFFICIENT_POWER_CONVERSION is required at
   every level of energy SUPPLY_CHAIN, from the producer to the consumer.  even
   more, the DEMAND of energy efficient and RELIABLE_POWER_CONVERSION is
   further strengthened by the CURRENT_EVOLUTION towards
   INTELLIGENT_ENERGY_NETWORKS, I.e.  SMART_GRIDS, which facilitate the
   PERVASIVE_INTEGRATION and deployment of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES. in the
   STATE_OF_THE_ART, SMART_GRIDS ELECTRICAL_ENERGY_GENERATION is based on the
   LOAD_DEMAND. when switching to RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES, this scheme becomes
   problematic because sources are not always available on DEMAND, unless a
   LARGE_COSTLY_STORAGE_CAPACITY is introduced; MOREOVER_ENERGY_COST for user
   during the DAY_PEAK_HOURS becomes very expensive for END_USERS. a cheaper
   solution is to match the LOAD_DEMAND with the instantaneously
   AVAILABLE_POWER and amount of stored energy.  in this paper, a new
   matchmaking solution based on MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM and GAME_THEORY has been
   developed and implemented, optimizing the SMART_GRID_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT and
   consequently reducing COSTS for END_USERS.  2014 ieee.

AB EFFECTIVE_BUSINESS_PROCESS_COLLABORATION between COMPANIES operating in a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN can bring about IMPORTANT_BENEFITS, but several BARRIERS_NEED
   to be overcome.  one IMPORTANT_OBSTACLE evidenced by professionals is
   related to the information and COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES used to support
   SUCH_COLLABORATION. although a supplier and a manufacturer may be willing to
   establish a closer relationship, a lack of easy_to_operate
   ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS can thwart their COLLABORATIVE_AMBITIONS.
   SPECIFIC_TECHNOLOGIES are required for each type of
   COLLABORATIVE_BUSINESS_PROCESS as GENERIC_APPLICATIONS do not lend
   themselves to addressing COMPLEX_SITUATIONS. COMPLEXITY lies in the need to
   consider COMMON_STANDARDS for information and DECISION_EXCHANGES, and for
   designing and implementing the RIGHT_INFORMATION and DECISION_FLOW among
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS to SUPPORT_COLLABORATIVE_PROCESSES. this PAPER_FOCUSES
   on COLLABORATION of DEMAND, PRODUCTION and REPLENISHMENT_PLANNING along a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN, and proposes a multi_tier, negotiation_based mechanism
   supported by a multi_agent SYSTEM. the RESEARCH_HYPOTHESIS is that
   improvements in the service and PROFIT_LEVEL of SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS, and in
   the entire SUPPLY_CHAIN, can be achieved by implementing this form of

   the SUPPLY_CHAIN (SC) PERFORMANCE_MEASUREMENT based on the global
   SUPPLY_CHAIN forum (gscf) REFERENCE_MODEL due to the complexities of

   a method to develop the required ONTOLOGIES for the PMS_AGENTS and developed
   the ONTOLOGIES in the WEB_ONTOLOGY_LANGUAGE (owl) to provide the

   and the ONTOLOGY which facilitate the INTEGRATION of GOODS_DATA in order to
   exploit and REUSE. indeed, to ENSURE_COMMUNICATION and INTEROPERABILITY of
   these data we relied on multi_agent systems, due to their characteristics of
   AUTONOMY, sociability and responsiveness that are generally associated.  the
   multi_agent systems can build FLEXIBLE_SYSTEMS whose behaviors are complex
   and complicated due to the combination of DIFFERENT_TYPES of AGENTS. with a
   focus on the importance of the concept of the TRACEABILITY, the OBJECTIVE of
   this work is to propose an INTELLIGENT_SYSTEM for the TRACEABILITY of

AB purpose: the INTEGRATION of BUSINESS_PROCESSES across MULTIPLE_COMPANIES can
   provide ECONOMIC_BENEFITS, thus ensuring the SUSTAINABILITY of the involved
   COMPANIES. however these advantages are accompanied by many POTENTIAL_RISKS.
   for instance, emerging DISRUPTIONS within a SUPPLY_CHAIN can spread over
   several partners resulting in ECONOMIC_LOSSES. the purpose of this paper is
   to focus on the DEVELOPMENT of a COLLABORATIVE cross_supply CHAIN_FRAMEWORK
   that reduces the extent of loss after the occurrence of unforeseen damaging
   events in SENSITIVE_LOGISTICS_NODES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/approach: to handle
   the impacts of unforeseen damaging events in SENSITIVE_LOGISTICS_NODES, the
   focus of our approach lies on the implementation of a collaboratively
   APPLICABLE_CONCEPT for SENSITIVE_LOGISTICS_NODES that supports a
   RAPID_COLLABORATIVE decision_making among the partners.  therefore,
   different damaging events as well as the LOGISTICS and TRANSPORT_PROCESSES
   in FREIGHT_VILLAGES are determined and implemented in an agent_based
   SIMULATION_MODEL. findings: multi_agent SIMULATION can be used for a
   scenario_based COLLABORATIVE_RISK_MANAGEMENT in SENSITIVE_LOGISTICS_NODES.
   by executing SIMULATION_EXPERIMENTS the impacts of selected damaging events
   can be analysed and used for the DEVELOPMENT of scenario SPECIFIC_STRATEGIES
   for the partners in SENSITIVE_LOGISTICS_NODES with the OBJECTIVE to maintain
   the flow of goods after disturbances.  PRACTICAL_IMPLICATIONS: the paper
   proposes a multi_agent SIMULATION, which can be used collaboratively in a
   cross_supply CHAIN_TEAM to support decision_making processes in
   SENSITIVE_LOGISTICS_NODES after a disruption has occurred.  to get an
   effective and EFFICIENT_TOOL, involved COMPANIES are included into the
   DEVELOPMENT and IMPLEMENTATION_PROCESSES. originality/value: the value of

   SUPPLY_CHAIN and optimizing the make span.  it exploits the OUTSOURCING of
   OPERATIONS feature by ITS AGENTS to conclude the MANUFACTURING_PROCESSES
   faster and reduce the IDLE_TIME of CERTAIN_MACHINES. this ARTICLE also

AB in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT, improving the EFFICIENCY of the overall
   SUPPLY_CHAIN is of KEY_INTEREST. because of MARKET_GLOBALIZATION and the
   advancement of e_commerce the importance of SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK is
   increasing.  a SUPPLY_CHAIN can produce products for MULTIPLE_MARKETS. also,
   an INDIVIDUAL_COMPANY is likely to have only limited VISIBILITY of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_STRUCTURE, which makes it difficult to make
   FUTURE_DEMAND_ESTIMATIONS, because the pattern of DEMAND_PROPAGATION through
   the SUPPLY_CHAIN depends on the capabilities and strategies of COMPANIES
   along the path from the markets to the company.  there will be the CONFLICT
   among the pursuit of the profit of all members of the SCM. in order to
   maximize the TOTAL_PROFIT of the SCM, NEGOTIATION among all members is
   necessary.  in this RESEARCH, we propose to find the best
   NEGOTIATION_STRATEGY that makes all members of the SCM satisfied in a
   SIMPLE_SCM. the ideas behind the suggested MODEL are NEGOTIATION_ALGORITHM
   with an AGENT and we consider multiplefactors that are price, REVIEW_POINT
   and DELIVERY_TIME. we create AGENTS with JAVA_AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK
   and performed the SIMULATION under JADE and ECLIPSE_ENVIRONMENT. we have
   used BENEFIT/COST ratio as a PERFORMANCE_MEASURE in order to compare our
   SYSTEM with KASBAH_SYSTEM that is a TYPICAL_SYSTEM well known to the world.
   users create AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS that buy and sell goods on their behalf in
   the KASBAH_SYSTEM.

AB based on LIFE_CYCLE, the COLLABORATION_MECHANISM in mobile SUPPLY_CHAIN of
   MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY was explored.  the PRODUCTION_DIFFUSION_PROCESS was
   described by using SYSTEM_DYNAMICS_THEORY. a COOPERATIVE_GAME_MODEL was
   built to examine PARTNER_SELECTION of MOBILE_OPERATORS. through
   EVOLUTION_GAME_THEORY, the COLLABORATION in MANUFACTURING alliance was
   discussed.  based on anylogic 6.5.0, a multi_agent SIMULATION_SYSTEM was
   developed and validated by LIFECYCLE_THEORY. the results showed that the
   COLLABORATION_EFFICIENCY of MATURATION_STAGE was improved by using
   MASS_MEDIA, and the word_of_mouth effect was better for DECLINE_STAGE, and
   the MATURATION_STAGE was extended; PENALTY_MECHANISM was beneficial to
   improve the COLLABORATION_LEVEL of MATURATION_STAGE, and the cycle of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN was extended; the COLLABORATION_LEVELS of GROWTH_STAGE and
   MATURATION_STAGE would be improved by increasing the MANUFACTURERS_SCALE and

AB many papers have discussed the BULLWHIP_EFFECT in SUPPLY_CHAIN. however,
   little RESEARCH has analyzed the impact of ECHELON_RATIO for
   BULLWHIP_EFFECT. this PAPER_AIMS at showing this impact in a three_echelon
   SUPPLY_CHAIN using multi_agent SIMULATION. the result indicates that
   BULLWHIP_EFFECT_EXISTS in not only single_player but also multi_player
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. in multi_player SUPPLY_CHAIN, ECHELON_RATIO is more sensitive
   than PLAYER_NUMBER to affect BULLWHIP_EFFECT. ORDER_QUANTITY_FLUCTUATION
   remains stable when ECHELON_RATIO_CHANGES for RETAILERS. but this
   fluctuation gradually decreases with the increase of ECHELON_RATIO for
   DISTRIBUTORS and MANUFACTURERS. when ECHELON_RATIO is relatively big, the
   AMPLIFICATION of ORDER_QUANTITY_FLUCTUATION from distributor to manufacturer
   is relatively small; and the MINIMAL_FLUCTUATION, the MAXIMAL_FLUCTUATION,
   the AVERAGE_FLUCTUATION are approximately the same at RETAILER or
   DISTRIBUTOR_ECHELON. these conclusions offer a MACROSCOPIC_MANAGEMENT_VIEW
   for reducing BULLWHIP_EFFECT. they can also provide references for
   estimating the BULLWHIP_EFFECT_MAGNITUDE of different SUPPLY_CHAINS.  2013

   compare the PERFORMANCE of a serial SUPPLY_CHAIN with that of a divergent
   SUPPLY_CHAIN, both under NON_INFORMATION SHARING and INFORMATION_SHARING
   conditions.  results show that the traditional (I.e.  without

   proposed solution is based on concepts of EVOLUTIONARY_SYSTEM_DESIGN that
   advocates for continued exploration of NEW_SOLUTIONS until a

   situations _ changes of DELIVERY_DATE, PRICE_ADJUSTMENTS, and

AB the study describes a SERVICE_MODEL and ITS mechanism, addressing a
   membership_type framework provided by MANUFACTURERS. recently,
   MANUFACTURING_INDUSTRIES are confronted with several problems such as
   SEVERE_PRICE_COMPETITION, shortening PRODUCT_LIFECYCLE, and the growing
   commoditization of products.  therefore, there is a movement for
   MANUFACTURERS to shift to the inclusion of SERVICE_ASPECTS. along with this
   trend, the concept of PRODUCT_SERVICE_SYSTEMS (pss) is proposed and several
   studies have been conducted so far.  as a case of pss, our STUDY_FOCUSES on
   a membership_type service like car_sharing, which has been growing recently.
   first, our STUDY_CONSTRUCTS three kinds of MODELS based on GAME_THEORY:
   CONVENTIONAL_PRODUCT selling, non_membership_type service in MANUFACTURING,
   and membership_type service in MANUFACTURING. these are theoretically
   analyzed using a game_theoretic approach.  second, we CONDUCT_EXPERIMENTS
   with HUMAN_SUBJECTS, based on the METHODOLOGY of EXPERIMENTAL_ECONOMICS.
   from those results, HUMAN_BEHAVIORAL_RULES are extracted.  third,
   implementing AGENTS with the BEHAVIORAL_RULES, multi_agent SIMULATION is
   run.  the SIMULATION_RESULTS present the same tendency as the
   THEORETICAL_ANALYSIS and demonstrate that, in the case of
   LARGE_PRODUCTION_COST, the membership_type service outperforms the other
   MODELS in terms of manufacturer'S profit.

AB congestion, POLLUTION, and SAFETY are some of the most worrisome
   side_effects of the URBAN_GOODS_MOVEMENT_ACTIVITIES. these problems are
   generally attributed to the underlying characteristics of the domain such as
   HETEROGENEOUS_STAKEHOLDERS, their conflicting objectives and resulting
   distributed decision_making.  SUCH_AUTONOMOUS decision_making STAKEHOLDERS
   do not efficiently cooperate and coordinate while performing
   CITY_LOGISTICS_ACTIVITIES. the ensuing INEFFICIENT_USE of RESOURCES (e.g.
   GOODS_DELIVERY_VEHICLE, time, etc.) gives rise to the above_mentioned
   problems.  to reduce the NEGATIVE_EXTERNALITIES of URBAN_GOODS_MOVEMENT, we
   first must understand the decision_making PROCESS of the
   CITY_LOGISTICS_STAKEHOLDER under DIFFERENT_SITUATIONS. agent_based
   SIMULATION_MODELLING TECHNIQUE is such an approach where distributed
   decision_making of the MULTIPLE_STAKEHOLDERS can be included by MODELLING
   each entity as an AUTONOMOUS_AGENT. in this paper, we propose the use of a
   KNOWLEDGE_DATA_MODEL of URBAN_FREIGHT domain _ CITY_LOGISTICS_ONTOLOGY _ to
   develop an agent_based MODEL. CITY_LOGISTICS_ONTOLOGY is a KNOWLEDGE_MODEL
   which includes CITY_LOGISTICS_ENTITIES (e.g.  STAKEHOLDERS, RESOURCES, etc.)
   and relationships between them in a structured form.  the PAPER_FOCUSES on
   the usefulness of ONTOLOGY in the DEVELOPMENT of agent_based MODEL for
   CITY_LOGISTICS_DOMAIN, and attempts to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   AGENT_TECHNOLOGY in analysing the URBAN_FREIGHT decision_making processes.

   ROAD_TRANSPORTATION_NETWORK by considering the ENVIRONMENTAL_CONDITIONS that
   are affecting the ACTUAL_TIME_TRAVEL of the travellers are vital especially
   in handling the LOGISTIC_OPERATIONS in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM).
   furthermore, the POLICY_STRATEGY is needed in order to influence the
   MANAGERS or drivers to find the optimum and the most EFFECTIVE_ROUTE for a
   TRIP_PLAN in supporting the LOGISTIC_OPERATIONS of SCM. in this paper we
   analyze the effectiveness of the COORDINATION_MODEL of the
   ENVIRONMENTAL_CONDITIONS that are affecting for the travelling time based on
   multi_agent SYSTEM for a ROAD_TRANSPORTATION_NETWORK for
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. a number of EXPERIMENTAL_CASES have been used to

AB SUPPLY_CHAINS are NETWORKS of loosely coupled BUSINESS_UNITS characterised
   by distinct, yet mutually interdependent, PLANNING DECISION_DOMAINS. the
   MAIN_QUESTION that arises in the MANAGEMENT of these NETWORKS is the
   COORDINATION of SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS' OPERATIONS with MINIMUM_EXCHANGE of
   information.  in practice, SUPPLY_CHAIN_OPERATIONS are generally coordinated
   and planned hierarchically, through the central and aggregated CONTROL of a
   corporate PLANNING unit, which requires a HIGH_DEGREE of
   INFORMATION_EXCHANGES, or through the relatively
   INEFFICIENT_UPSTREAM_PLANNING_APPROACH, in which OPERATIONS are planned and
   the derived DEPENDENT_DEMAND is sent to SUPPLIERS. HIGH_DEGREE of
   INFORMATION_EXCHANGES_LEAD to difficulties when INDEPENDENT_MEMBERS do not
   want to SHARE_INFORMATION, such as COST, profit margin, INVENTORY_LEVEL or
   CAPACITY_UTILISATION. in order to address these difficulties, DECENTRALISED
   approaches of COORDINATION of OPERATIONS_PLANNING decisions based on some
   MINIMAL_INFORMATION SHARING have been proposed in many ACADEMIC_DISCIPLINES.
   this paper first proposes a SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW of these approaches, and then

AB over the last few decades, a RAPID_ADVANCEMENT in the arena of TECHNOLOGY
   has escalated the COMPETITIVE_SCENARIO across the globe.  several COMPANIES
   are now using INTELLIGENT_SYSTEMS to assist their SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT
   activities.  this RESEARCH, therefore, attempts to explore the advantage of
   using INTELLIGENT_SYSTEMS in managing SUPPLY_CHAIN activities.  a REVIEW of
   the LITERATURE_SHOWS that with growing DEMAND of FOOD_PRODUCTS, improved
   SUPPLY and STORAGE_FACILITIES, and STRONG_EMPHASIS on CROSS_BOUNDARY_TRADE
   and POLICIES have generated a lot of interest among researchers to look at
   the issues faced in the food SUPPLY_CHAIN. researchers have attempted to
   study VARIOUS_TYPES of food SUPPLY_CHAINS; however, little emphasis has been
   given to study the WINE SUPPLY_CHAIN INDUSTRY. one of the key challenges
   that exist in WINE SUPPLY_CHAIN is the INTEGRATION among the KEY_MEMBERS of
   the SUPPLY_CHAIN to accomplish a COLLECTIVE_SET of tasks.  this paper,
   therefore, aims to address the SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION_ISSUE. to achieve
   better COORDINATION among the WINE SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS, this paper put
   forward the use of an INTELLIGENT_AGENT based ARCHITECTURE_FRAMEWORK. the
   PAPER_SUGGESTS that the proposed INTELLIGENT multi_agent framework can
   reduce the COMPLEXITY of DECISION_MAKING_PROCESS, improve the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION, and assist the SCM_MANAGERS in smooth running of

AB CURRENT_APPROACHES to SERVICE_COMPOSITION are mostly based on centralized
   CONTROL_MODEL, and suffer from SCALABILITY, PERFORMANCE, and
   ROBUSTNESS_ISSUES. in this paper we propose a DECENTRALIZED multi_agent
   MODEL for SERVICE_COMPOSITION, DRAWING_INSPIRATION from NATURAL_SYSTEMS. the
   idea is that the composition will "emerge" from LOCAL_SERVICE_INTERACTION,
   using HOLONIC_ORGANIZATIONAL_THEORY for adaptation.  in a holonic
   multi_agent SYSTEM, a holon is a concept of coalition that is formed through
   COMMITMENTS_AMONGST_AGENTS and induces an EMERGENT_STRUCTURE_AMONGST_AGENTS.
   a prototype is developed based on JADE_PLATFORM and
   WEB_SERVICES_INTEGRATION_GATEWAY to implement the proposed DECENTRALIZED
   multi_agent SERVICE_COMPOSITION MODEL. furthermore, a CASE_STUDY is
   presented on SERVICE_COMPOSITION_PROBLEM for a distributed
   GENERATION_ELECTRICITY SUPPLY_CHAIN. SIMULATION_EXPERIMENTS with
   DIFFERENT_SCENARIOS of the VOLATILE_ELECTRICITY SUPPLY_CHAIN in
   DISTRIBUTED_GENERATION are conducted to validate our proposed DECENTRALIZED
   multi_agent approach.  when compared with centralized CONTROL_APPROACH,
   which is clearly limited when dealing with large_scale systems, our proposed
   APPROACH_PERFORMS favorably in tackling increased SYSTEMS_COMPLEXITY and
   scale, though DECENTRALIZED multi_agent approach does generate a larger
   MESSAGE_OVERHEAD and longer SERVICE_DISCOVERY_TIMES.  2013_ios press and the

AB PERFORMANCE_MEASUREMENT by means of KEY_PERFORMANCE_INDICATORS (kpis) is a
   WIDESPREAD_DEVICE for communicating qualitative and
   QUANTITATIVE_BUSINESS_OBJECTIVES throughout an ORGANIZATION and MONITORING
   their achievement.  it seems desirable to also apply this concept to
   dependably influencing the OPERATIONAL_BEHAVIOUR of distributed AGENT
   controlled processes, which have progressively gained in importance in
   PRODUCTION_LOGISTICS and CONTROL over RECENT_YEARS as compared to
   centralized CONTROL_METHODS. however, PLANNING_AND_SCHEDULING with
   NUMERIC_GOAL_SYSTEMS at present still poses a CHALLENGING_TASK within the
   field of COMPUTATIONAL_INTELLIGENCE. in this paper, a framework is presented
   that enables GLOBAL_COORDINATION of AGENTS in a multi_agent SYSTEM through
   user_configurable numeric KEY_PERFORMANCE_INDICATORS and associated
   objectives.  a PRACTICAL_APPROACH to DISTRIBUTED_CONTROL based on
   PERIODICAL_MATHEMATICAL_OPTIMIZATION of the defined KPI_GOAL_SYSTEM is
   described that focuses on how AUTOMATIC_KEY_FIGURE_AGGREGATION over changing
   groups and hierarchies of AGENTS and other BUSINESS_OBJECTS can be
   appropriately managed when PROACTIVE_MODIFICATION of these
   ORGANIZATIONAL_STRUCTURES, e.g., AGENTS deliberately FORMING and disbanding
   groups, is an INTEGRAL_PART of the CONTROL_PROBLEM. five variants of this
   approach are compared in a CASE_STUDY with a simulated SHOP_FLOOR where

AB this PAPER_ILLUSTRATES a NEW_DIAMOND_SHAPE_ARCHITECTURE based on
   MULTI_AGENTS for SUPPLY_CHAIN in an UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENT. there are many
   situations in which a convincing answer to a query cannot be found in the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN of a company such as DISRUPTIONS or sanctions, etc.  thus there
   is a need of connection between different SUPPLY_CHAINS of
   DIFFERENT_COMPANIES in a PARTICULAR_INDUSTRY. the proposed
   ARCHITECTURE_ADDRESSES a META_INFORMATION_AGENT as the core of the
   ARCHITECTURE in order to connect INFORMATION_AGENTS of various SUPPLY_CHAINS
   in a same INDUSTRY and keep information flowing through them.  the brokering
   method has been used to establish this connection.  FUZZY_QUERY_APPROACH is
   considered to tackle UNCERTAINTY_PROBLEMS. the results show that our
   proposed approach is more reliable than other architectures and can increase

   these DISASTERS require a consequent quick and EFFICIENT_RESPONSE that
   depends on the ability of LOGISTICS_SYSTEMS to GENERATE_PLANS under a

   into multiple sub_regions.  each area is assigned a
   DELIVERY_SCHEDULING_SUB_PROBLEM. by employing a distributed
   COOPERATIVE_FRAMEWORK, we achieved an incorporation of

   maintain a HIGH_LEVEL of SYNCHRONIZATION of all the SUPPLY_CHAIN, and so to
   insure a better response to the crisis.  2013 copyright the authors.

AB MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEMS (MAS) are particularly suitable for the MODELLING and
   analysis of the STRUCTURE_AND_DYNAMICS of INDUSTRIAL_COMPLEX_SYSTEMS. they
   are often used in SUPPLY_CHAINS as a support for decision_making and seem
   especially helpful to test and analyze
   DIFFERENT_CONTROL_DESIGN_ALTERNATIVES. however, the lack of
   EVALUATION_METHODS of MAS is a MAJOR_DISINCENTIVE to their use in
   SUCH_REAL_WORLD_APPLICATIONS. in this paper, a MAS_EVALUATION_METHOD is
   first presented.  it focuses on COMMUNICATION as it is one of the most
   IMPORTANT_FUNCTIONAL_CHARACTERISTICS of DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEMS in general and
   MAS in particular.  then three MULTIAGENT_MODELS representing different
   SUPPLY_CHAIN CONTROL_ARCHITECTURES (distributed, centralized and mixed) are
   presented, evaluated and compared according to the advanced method.
   experimentation is carried out with reference to a test_case

AB it is a growing trend for SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS to collaborate in a
   VIRTUAL_ENTERPRISE (ve). as VE_MEMBERS are usually geographically dispersed
   and they have to cooperate and negotiate to achieve MUTUAL_AGREEMENTS, the
   distributive multi_agent systems (MAS) are being increasingly adopted for
   VE_IMPLEMENTATION. to cope with the FLEXIBILITY_REQUIREMENTS of ve, a
   NEW_MAS_ARCHITECTURE is proposed in this paper.  in this MAS, the
   VE_INITIATOR can be represented by either stationary or MOBILE_AGENTS to
   negotiate with VE_PARTNERS. as there is not a mobile agent_based
   NEGOTIATION_SCHEME considering both the NEGOTIATION_EFFECTIVENESS and
   SYSTEM_SECURITY, a HYBRID multi_agent NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL is established in
   this paper to tackle this problem.  this HYBRID_PROTOCOL_INCORPORATES both
   the stationary and MOBILE_AGENT_NEGOTIATION_PHASES to compose a more
   efficient and SUCCESSFUL_MULTILATERAL_AGENT_INTERACTION_REGULATION. in this
   NEGOTIATION_PROCESS, mobile agent_based NEGOTIATION is first initiated, it
   will then switch to stationary agent_based NEGOTIATION when
   MOBILE_AGENT_MIGRATION is rejected or INTERACTION is blocked in the
   REMOTE_HOST. besides, the ontology_based approach is adopted in the MAS and
   an embedding ONTOLOGY_OPERATION_PROTOCOL is established to refine the

   approach is particularly important for the DECISION_MODELS with an
   OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION and many DISCRETE_DECISION_VARIABLES added up in

   COOPERATION_COSTS to set up and maintain the GAME in the first place has not
   been addressed thus far.  this PAPER_ADDRESSES this question for the
   COOPERATIVE_TRANSSHIPMENT_GAMES with IDENTICAL_AGENTS having normally
   distributed INDEPENDENT_DEMANDS. we provide characterization of
   EQUAL_ALLOCATIONS which are in the core of SYMMETRIC_GAMES, and prove that
   not all TRANSSHIPMENT_GAMES are convex.  in particular, we prove that though
   INDIVIDUAL_ALLOCATIONS grow with the COALITION_SIZE, the GROWTH_DIMINISHES
   according to two RULES of diminishing INDIVIDUAL_ALLOCATIONS. these results
   are the basis for studying the games with COOPERATION_COSTS. we MODEL the
   COOPERATION_COSTS by the COOPERATION_NETWORK_TOPOLOGY and the
   COOPERATION_COST per NETWORK_LINK. we consider two NETWORK_TOPOLOGIES, the
   clique and the hub, and prove bounds for the COST per link that render
   coalitions stable.  these bounds always limit COALITION_SIZE for cliques.
   however, the opposite is shown for hubs, namely newsvendors can afford
   COOPERATION_COSTS only if their coalition is sufficiently large.  2013

AB SUPPLIER_SELECTION is an IMPORTANT_PROBLEM in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM),
   and has attracted the attention of many researchers.  TREMENDOUS_EFFORT has
   been spent on the DEVELOPMENT of agent_based systems to
   AUTOMATE_SUPPLIER_SELECTION_NEGOTIATION_PROCESS in SCM_APPLICATIONS. in this
   kind of multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS), SOFTWARE_AGENTS are established to
   represent VARIOUS_PARTIES and FUNCTIONS involving in the
   SUPPLIER_SELECTION_NEGOTIATION_PROCESS. most of CURRENT_SYSTEMS only deal
   with relatively SIMPLE_NEGOTIATIONS involving the acquisition of one
   product, they are not sufficient to support COMPLEX_NEGOTIATIONS involving
   MULTIPLE_PRODUCTS with SYNERGY_EFFECT. however, in practice, it is common
   for a PURCHASING company to procure MULTIPLE_PRODUCTS simultaneously, and
   the synergy effects that exist between products could affect the
   FINAL_CHOICE of COOPERATIVE_SUPPLIERS. this paper presents an agent_based
   NEGOTIATION_MODEL to automate the SUPPLIER_SELECTION_PROCESS involving a
   bundle of products with SYNERGY_EFFECT. a MAS is established to realize the
   proposed NEGOTIATION_MODEL for multi_product SUPPLIER_SELECTION.
   furthermore, the NEGOTIATION_PROPOSAL, NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL,
   NEGOTIATION_STRATEGIES, and DECISION_MAKING_METHODS involving in the
   NEGOTIATION_MODEL are elaborated for the multi_product SUPPLIER_SELECTION
   ENVIRONMENT. through the proposed NEGOTIATION_MODEL, the PURCHASING company
   and SUPPLIERS can reach agreements on the details of products simultaneously
   and exploit the SYNERGY_EFFECT between products.  finally,
   ILLUSTRATIVE_EXAMPLES are conducted to demonstrate the function and
   effectiveness of the NEGOTIATION_MODEL for multi_product SUPPLIER_SELECTION.

   DISRUPTION_RISKS, SOCIAL_RISKS, and demand_side UNCERTAINTY within an
   integrated global SUPPLY_CHAIN and CORPORATE_SOCIAL_RESPONSIBILITY (CSR)
   MODELLING and ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK. the global SUPPLY_CHAIN decision_makers
   must decide on the level of INVESTMENT in CSR_ACTIVITIES and the choice of
   TRADING_PARTNERS (manufacturer or RETAILER) given their CSR_CONSCIOUSNESS
   and perceived riskiness in order to MAXIMISE_PROFIT and minimise their
   OVERALL_RISK. the MODEL_INCORPORATES INDIVIDUAL_ATTITUDES towards
   DISRUPTION_RISKS among the MANUFACTURERS and the RETAILERS, with the demands
   for the product associated with the RETAILERS being random.  the MODEL
   allows one to investigate the effects of HETEROGENEOUS_CSR_ACTIVITIES in a
   global SUPPLY_CHAIN and to compute the RESULTANT_EQUILIBRIUM_PATTERN of
   PRODUCT_OUTPUTS, transactions, PRODUCT_PRICES, and levels of

AB TRANSPORTATION_ENGINEERING, and especially of DANGEROUS_GOODS (dg), is one
   of the areas in which TECHNOLOGICAL_DEVELOPMENT is crucial.
   LOGISTIC_CONTROL_SYSTEMS, routing and SCHEDULING_ALGORITHMS,
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT have been applied in this aspect so as to improve
   the cost_effectiveness ratio and to reduce RISKS. unfortunately, most of
   these works remain theoretical since tests on REAL_CASE_SCENARIO sometimes
   proves difficult to achieve especially when we are dealing with
   DANGEROUS_GOODS_TRANSPORT (dgt). in this paper, an ARCHITECTURE of a
   VISUAL_DGT_SIMULATION_SYSTEM has been introduced.  it provides entries for
   testing these works and produces results close to REAL_EXPERIMENTS.
   APPLICATIONS on SERIOUS_GAMES, FINANCIAL_MARKET, engineering are evidence of
   success of the VISUAL_SIMULATION_SYSTEM. thus, the challenge consists on how
   to DESIGN a SYSTEM that represents real_world systems with an
   APPROPRIATE_DEGREE of COMPLEXITY and DYNAMICS. several researchers have
   already suggested SOLUTIONS since the 50s.  these SOLUTIONS have been
   classified in three levels: microscopic, mesoscopic and
   MACROSCOPIC_SIMULATION. it has been decided to use a MICROSCOPIC_APPROACH
   using an agent_based MODEL. it allows the representation of systems at
   DIFFERENT_LEVELS of COMPLEXITY, a SYSTEM_OF_SYSTEMS (sos), through the use
   of autonomous, goal_driven and interacting entities.  the SYSTEM is
   implemented using the SOFTWARE_MATSIM (http://www.matsim.org/). the

   CONSTRAINT_LOGIC programming (clp)) and two types of AGENTS were integrated.
   the strengths of mp and clp, in which constraints are treated in a
   DIFFERENT_WAY and DIFFERENT_METHODS are implemented, were combined to use
   the strengths of both.  the proposed approach is particularly important for
   the DECISION_MODELS with an OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION and many
   DISCRETE_DECISION_VARIABLES added up in MULTIPLE_CONSTRAINTS. the
   two_echelon capacitated VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM (2e_cvrp) is an extension of
   the classical capacitated VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM (cvrp) where the delivery
   depot_customers pass through INTERMEDIATE_DEPOTS (called SATELLITES).
   multi_echelon DISTRIBUTION systems are quite common in supply_chain and

AB the aim of this paper is to study how the STRUCTURAL_FACTORS of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS, (I.e.  the number of echelons, the number of nodes
   and the DISTRIBUTION of links) impact on ITS DYNAMICS_PERFORMANCE (I.e.
   BULLWHIP_EFFECT). to do so, we systematically MODEL MULTIPLE_STRUCTURES
   according to a ROBUST_DESIGN of EXPERIMENTS and simulate SUCH_STRUCTURES
   under two DIFFERENT_MARKET_DEMAND_SCENARIOS. the former emulates a
   STATIONARY_CONDITION of the MARKET, while the latter reproduce the
   EXTREME_VOLATILITY and IMPETUOUS_ALTERATION of the MARKET produced by the
   CURRENT_ECONOMIC_RECESSION. RESULTS_CONTRIBUTE to the SCIENTIFIC_DEBATE on
   SUPPLY_CHAIN DYNAMICS by showing how the advocated number of echelons is not
   the only STRUCTURAL_FACTOR that exacerbates the BULLWHIP_EFFECT. in
   particular, under a SUDDEN_SHOCK in MARKET_DEMAND, the number of nodes and
   the divergence of the SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK affect the

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_FORMATION is the PROCESS of determining the participants in a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN, who will exchange what with whom, and the terms of the
   exchanges.  DECENTRALIZED SUPPLY_CHAIN_FORMATION appears as a highly
   INTRICATE_TASK because AGENTS only possess LOCAL_INFORMATION and have
   limited KNOWLEDGE about the capabilities of other AGENTS. the DECENTRALIZED
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_FORMATION problem has been recently cast as an
   OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEM that can be efficiently approximated using max_sum
   loopy BELIEF_PROPAGATION. this mapping can be improved by encoding the
   problem into a BINARY_FACTOR_GRAPH (containing only BINARY_VARIABLES) and
   deriving model_specific equations for max_sum.  first, this PAPER_INTRODUCES
   the state_of_the art methods for DECENTRALIZED SUPPLY_CHAIN_FORMATION.
   second, it presents future short_term lines of RESEARCH in this problem.
   finally, it argues that the BINARY_MODEL can be extended to other problems
   than that of the SUPPLY_CHAIN_FORMATION. copyright  2013,

AB this paper presents an agent_based framework for CONFIGURATION of agile
   SUPPLY_CHAINS. the presented framework, referred to as digital MANUFACTURING
   MARKET (dmm), is implemented in JAVA_AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK (JADE). in
   the dmm, SUPPLY and DEMAND_ENTITIES are represented by
   INTELLIGENT_SOFTWARE_AGENTS. the DMM_AGENTS_COMMUNICATE and interact
   dynamically for solving a given SUPPLY_CHAIN_FORMATION problem.
   MEDIATOR_AGENTS use their INTERNAL_SEARCH and DISCOVERY_ALGORITHMS to

   SEMANTIC_SIMILARITIES with respect to TECHNOLOGICAL_CAPABILITIES and needs.
   MANUFACTURING SERVICE_DESCRIPTION_LANGUAGE (msdl) is the ONTOLOGY of the dmm

   RESEARCH is to demonstrate the first application of AGENT_TECHNOLOGY for
   SUPPLY_CHAIN CONFIGURATION based on a FORMAL_ONTOLOGY that encodes the
   MANUFACTURING capabilities of MANUFACTURING SUPPLIERS. in this
   implementation, distributed ONTOLOGY_SEGMENTATION and SHARING is
   investigated as well.  EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS are provided based on a sample
   of SUPPLIERS and CUSTOMERS from the contract MANUFACTURING domain.  although

AB the MAIN_PURPOSES and challenges in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT are reducing
   COST and time.  significantly, factors such as the COMPETITION of markets in
   the globe, limitation of energy, raw and VIRGIN_MATERIALS,
   ENVIRONMENTAL_PROTECTION_CRISIS and increasing of GLOBAL_POPULATION
   dramatically are causing UNPRECEDENTED_ISSUES for the worldwide
   SUPPLY_CHAINS for providing goods and services to CUSTOMERS efficiently and
   effectively.  the SUSTAINABILITY_APPROACH for SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM)
   considers the 6RS_PRINCIPLES in four MAIN_STAGES of the SUPPLY_CHAINS:
   pre_manufacture, MANUFACTURE, use and post_use.  the use of multi_agent
   SYSTEM (MAS) prepares the most IMPORTANT_REQUIREMENTS of an effective
   sustainable SUPPLY_CHAIN. at the same time, this agent_based approach
   provides reliable and AGILE_SYSTEMS, which will ENABLE_ENTERPRISES to

   ARTICLE, the use of MAS for optimal sustainable SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT
   (sscm) is reviewed and the integrated functioning of CERTAIN_AGENTS
   resulting in INFORMATION_SHARING is also demonstrated.  with this idea, an
   attempt is made to provide a MAS_MODEL for the sscm.  in the proposed MODEL,

AB the AMPLIFICATION of DEMAND_VARIATION in a SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK (scn) is a
   well_known phenomenon called the BULLWHIP_EFFECT, which
   CREATES_INEFFICIENCIES due to HIGH_VARIATION in the ORDER_QUANTITIES placed
   between COMPANIES, leading to a flow of a larger number of units than the
   ACTUAL_NEED, increasing stock and generating stock_outs.  since this
   phenomenon has been recognised as one of the MAIN_OBSTACLES for improving
   SCN_PERFORMANCE, recently it has received a lot of attention by SCN_MANAGERS
   and researchers.  one of the most common SIMPLIFYING_ASSUMPTIONS in the
   literature is to assume that the SCN_ADOPTS a SERIAL_STRUCTURE. the
   PRESENT_WORK_ADDRESSES a COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS of the BULLWHIP_EFFECT between
   a SERIAL_SCN and a more COMPLEX_DIVERGENT_SCN. to do so, we analyse the
   response of both scns under two DIFFERENT_INPUT_DEMANDS: a STATIONARY_DEMAND
   and an IMPULSE_DEMAND. the results reveal that there are not
   SIGNIFICANT_DIFFERENCES in terms of BULLWHIP_EFFECT between both scns for a
   STATIONARY_DEMAND. nevertheless, we show how for a VIOLENT_DISTURBANCE in
   CUSTOMER_DEMAND there is a great different between the two scns.  2013

AB the EMERGENCE of the RFID_TECHNOLOGY and ITS application to

   SUCH_STANDARDS as the epcglobal'S MODEL of SUPPLY_NETWORKS as a tool for
   materializing intra_ and inter_enterprise VISIBILITY of RESOURCES and
   products, COLLABORATION and INTEGRATION. among other CRITICAL_USES, RFID has
   been deployed by SUPPLY_NETWORKS to improve ASSET_UTILIZATION, effectively
   combat counterfeiting, and advance targeted product recalls.  however, new
   affordable and DEPLOYABLE_TECHNOLOGIES and microsensors have recently
   appeared and keep maturing.  this PAPER_DISCUSSES the needs and the

   RFID to guarantee continuous and SEAMLESS_VISIBILITY of all assets (fixed
   and MOBILE_RESOURCES and FIELD_PERSONNEL) of SMART_ENTERPRISES, thereby
   expanding and complementing the roles of RFID. it examines the DESIGN
   challenges for the INTEGRATION of these technologies for advanced
   LOGISTICS_OPERATIONS at the level of PRODUCT_CLASSES or their instances.  it
   then outlines our DEVELOPMENT of an embedded microsystem that combines RFID,
   gprs, gps and ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSORS for APPLICATIONS in LOGISTICS. the
   prototyped microsystem demonstrated the feasibility of the multi_sensor

   however, SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM is difficult to analyze due to ITS COMPLEXITY.
   it is beneficial for SUPPLY_CHAIN DESIGN and MANAGEMENT by simulating and
   evaluating OPERATIONAL_PERFORMANCE before ITS implementation.  therefore,
   this paper proposes a multi_agent framework for SUPPLY_CHAIN operational
   EVALUATION, which developed by JADE and in compliance with HLA. by
   perceiving SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM from the FRACTAL_PERSPECTIVE, in this
   framework, a fractal based SIMULATION_MODELING approach is introduced, which
   is a FLEXIBLE_APPROACH for MODELING SIMULATION_MODELS of specific
   SUPPLY_CHAIN scenarios.  on this basis, the REAL_OPERATIONAL_PERFORMANCE of
   a specific SUPPLY_CHAIN can be forecasted in this framework through
   SIMULATION, which can provides a SCIENTIFIC_EVIDENCE for DECISION_MAKING in
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. finally, a CASE_STUDY is given to illustrate the

AB in the military, agile and robust military SUPPLY_CHAINS are key in
   providing TIMELY_RESPONSES to SUPPORT_OPERATIONS in theatre.  SUPPLY during
   peacetime can be managed by PROACTIVE_LOGISTICS_PLANS and classic
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT techniques to guaranty the availability of required
   needs.  however, in case of PERTURBATIONS (time of war,
   NATURAL_DISASTERS...) the need for SUPPORT_INCREASES dramatically and
   LOGISTICS_PLANS_NEED to be adjusted rapidly.  to do that, we propose to use
   ANTICIPATION_MECHANISMS. an ANTICIPATOR_USES a WORLD_MODEL to construct
   FUTURE_PREDICTIONS about the SUPPLY_CHAIN and checks whether an
   UNDESIRABLE_STATE may be reached.  if it is the case, the ANTICIPATOR_ADAPTS
   his behavior to avoid the actions responsible of this state.  in this paper,

AB in this paper, multi_agent SYSTEM is applied into SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS,
   where multi_item NEGOTIATION between MULTIPLE_MANUFACTURER_AGENTS (ma) and
   MULTIPLE_MATERIAL_SUPPLIER_AGENTS (msa) is discussed.  a combined
   COALITION_FORMATION_PROTOCOL is proposed when the order of ma is out of
   ability of msa.  not only is COALITION_FORMATION for complementary
   considered, but also COALITION_FORMATION for substitution is taken into
   account.  the coalition which MAXIMIZES_PROFIT of LEADER_MSA will be
   determined as the FINAL_COALITION. NEGOTIATION between ma and final
   determined coalition is modeled as a STACKELBERG_GAME, and the finding of
   agreement is transformed into determining STACKELBERG_EQUILIBRIUM.

AB the multi_agent SUPPLY_CHAIN_SIMULATION framework macsima is described for
   the DESIGN of large_scale SUPPLY_NETWORK topologies consisting of a
   multitude of AUTONOMOUS_BUSINESS_AGENTS exchanging goods over an electronic
   b2b_marketplace.  macsima provides an INTEROPERABILITY_FRAMEWORK supporting
   the IDENTIFICATION of POTENTIAL_INTERACTION_PARTNERS and the mapping of
   HETEROGENEOUS_ONTOLOGIES between them.  this framework can be used for
   realizing the negotiation_based COORDINATION of self_interested AGENTS by
   using a NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL for BILATERAL_PRICE_NEGOTIATIONS together with
   an ADAPTIVE_NEGOTIATION_MODULE. if AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS are provided with the
   NEGOTIATION_MODULE they are able to adapt their NEGOTIATION_STRATEGIES to
   dynamically changing partners and MARKET_CONDITIONS. MACSIMA_SUPPORTS a
   fine_tuning of the PARAMETERIZATION of the LEARNING_MECHANISMS and enables

   NEGOTIATION. in the first MODEL (ags), the FAIR_AGENT_INTERVENES when an
   AGENT makes a relatively low or high offer; he asks this AGENT to behave
   differently.  in the second MODEL (dgs), the FAIR_AGENT_INTERVENES when a
   SIGNIFICANT_DIFFERENCE appears between the MARGIN_RATES of the negotiators;
   he directs them by giving the NEW_RATE to apply in the next step.

AB self_serving assets (ssas) are a NEW_INTERPRETATION of the
   INTELLIGENT_PRODUCT_TECHNOLOGY, set to
   TRANSFORM_PRODUCT_LIFECYCLE_MANAGEMENT through AUTOMATION. ssas are
   ENGINEERING_ASSETS that autonomously monitor their health and EXPIRY_DATES,
   search for SUPPLIERS, and negotiate with them, while they are still in use
   by the customer.  the concept enables more timely and
   TRANSPARENT_SUPPLIER_DECISION_MAKING while eliminating
   CENTRAL_DATABASE_TRANSACTIONS and tedious MANUAL_EFFORT. autonomous
   self_interested AGENTS that act on behalf of their STAKEHOLDERS naturally
   give rise to an ALLOCATION_PROBLEM, under the assumption of
   PRIVATE_INFORMATION held by TRADE_PARTIES and capacity constrained SUPPLIERS
   providing imperfectly SUBSTITUTABLE_GOODS (isgs). in this paper, we develop
   and compare three automated COMPETITION_MECHANISMS, constructed as
   ITERATIVE_GAMES, and test them in the context of the AEROSPACE_SERVICE
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. the COMPETITION_MECHANISMS include a prioritized
   SELECTION_MECHANISM, extended vickrey, and REVERSE_DUTCH_AUCTIONS. our
   context drives us to seek MECHANISMS that will not only perform well in
   terms of ECONOMIC_THEORY, but also in terms of COMPUTATIONAL_PERFORMANCE.
   KEY_FINDINGS are that extended VICKREY_AUCTIONS can handle MULTIPLE_CRITERIA
   and provide higher MARKET_EFFICIENCY at lower COMPUTATIONAL_COST, especially
   in small to MEDIUM_MARKETS. as SCALABILITY is an issue in LARGE_MARKETS, the
   use of AUCTIONS is recommended only for COMPLEX_HIGH_VALUE_ASSETS or under
   UNCERTAIN_MARKET_SCENARIOS. as business_to_business (B2B) environments are

AB MANUFACTURING SUPPLY_CHAINS (msc) are large_scale DISTRIBUTION_NETWORKS in
   which MULTIPLE_TYPES of commodities are present.  in this paper,
   OPERATIONS_MANAGEMENT in MANUFACTURING SUPPLY_CHAINS is stated as a tracking
   CONTROL_PROBLEM: INVENTORY_LEVELS at the network should follow desired
   values over time.  a cooperative multi_agent MODEL_PREDICTIVE_CONTROL (MPC)
   scheme for OPERATIONS_MANAGEMENT in MANUFACTURING SUPPLY_CHAINS is proposed.
   the msc is decomposed into subsystems using a FLOW_DECOMPOSITION. two
   DIFFERENT_TYPES of subsystems are possible, TRANSPORT_SUBSYSTEMS for
   PHYSICAL_CONNECTIONS or PRODUCTION_SUBSYSTEMS for MANUFACTURING goods.  a
   CONTROL_AGENT is assigned to each subsystem for OPERATIONS_MANAGEMENT.
   CONTROL_AGENTS solve their problems in a so_called PULLFLOW_PERSPECTIVE,
   starting at the END_NODES and propagating upstream.  contracted commodity
   sets per CONTROL_AGENT are proposed to limit the COMPUTATIONAL_BURDEN when a
   subset of the AVAILABLE_COMMODITIES are handled at a subsystem.  the
   multi_agent MPC PERFORMANCE is illustrated using a msc composed of
   SUPPLIERS, a plant, RETAIL_CENTERS, and END_NODES using
   DIFFERENT_PREDICTION_POLICIES for COMMODITY_DEMANDS. the PREDICTION_ABILITY
   of each CONTROL_AGENT can be used to keep the INVENTORY_LEVELS at the
   END_NODES constant over time and guarantee COOPERATION between all
   CONTROL_AGENTS.  ifac.

AB today'S_COMPETITION between COMPANIES has been turned into the COMPETITION
   between their SUPPLY_CHAINS. to satisfy the rapidly changing DEMAND in
   GLOBAL_MARKET, SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM) must be agile and flexible
   enough.  in AGILE_SCM, some INTELLIGENT_ACTIVITIES, such as NEGOTIATION,
   DECISION and COLLABORATION, have become the "bottleneck" to improve ITS
   PERFORMANCE. this paper explored the application of MOBILE_AGENT (ma) to
   deal with the INTELLIGENT_ACTIVITIES in SCM and thereof improve ITS
   AGILE_CAPABILITY. first, a mobile agent_based AGILE_SCM_WORK_MODEL was
   presented, and then the DEVELOPMENT of MOBILE_AGENT and ITS application in
   that SCM were discussed.  finally, the MOBILE_AGENT_SYSTEM for AGILE_SCM was
   described by the case of flower trading.  it can deal with the trading
   processes intelligently and automatically.  2011 ACADEMY_PUBLISHER.

AB TIME_SERIES are found widely in engineering and science.  we study
   FORECASTING of stochastic, DYNAMIC_SYSTEMS based on observations from
   MULTIVARIATE_TIME_SERIES. we MODEL the domain as a dynamic multiply
   sectioned BAYESIAN_NETWORK (dmsbn) and populate the domain by a set of
   proprietary, COOPERATIVE_AGENTS. we propose an ALGORITHM_SUITE that allows
   the AGENTS to perform one_step FORECASTS with distributed
   PROBABILISTIC_INFERENCE. we show that as long as the dmsbn is structural
   time_invariant (possibly parametric time_variant), the FORECAST is exact and
   ITS TIME_COMPLEXITY is exponentially more efficient than using
   DYNAMIC_BAYESIAN_NETWORKS (dbns). in comparison with independent dbn_based
   AGENTS, MULTIAGENT_DMSBNS produce more ACCURATE_FORECASTS. the effectiveness
   of the framework is demonstrated through EXPERIMENTS on a SUPPLY_CHAIN

AB in order to study the law of EMERGENCE and ITS INTERNAL_ATTRIBUTABLE_CAUSES
   according to the RESOURCES owned by AGENTS that interacts with each other in
   the COMPLEX_ADAPTIVE_SYSTEM about the SUPPLY_CHAIN, at the beginning the
   RESOURCES which the AGENTS in the SUPPLY_CHAIN draw are defined as
   followings: the RESOURCES outside SYSTEM, the RESOURCES in the SYSTEM, the
   RESOURCES that other else AGENTS own, and the DYNAMIC_RESOURCES the AGENT
   itself own, the multi_compartment AGENT of RESOURCES. the OPERATING_POINTS
   of eight RESOURCES owned by AGENTS_INTERACT with each other are controlled
   through eight RANDOM_NUMBERS, the direction, degree, speed and STABILITY of
   RESOURCES_FLOW during INTERACTION among AGENTS are described respectively by
   matching capability, MATCHING_SPEED and matching time; furthermore, the
   EVOLUTION_PROCESS about the RESOURCES among AGENTS interacting is described
   by RULES of gef(global evaluate function) and lef(local evaluate function),
   RESOURCES_FLOW_MODEL of COMPLEX_SYSTEM about the SUPPLY_CHAIN is
   established; eventually, through simulating respectively in the
   SWARM_PLATFORM both the proposed MODEL and the SIMPLE_MODEL that doesn't
   cunsder the multi_compartment AGENT but the LINEAR_SUM of all RESOURCES, it
   is found that the former describes the CHANGE_RULE of the resource more
   accurately in the SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM. it means that syncretizing eight
   RESOURCES, which interact and inter_constrain in the SYSTEM, to an
   indiscerptible one is the attributable cause of the EMERGENCE.  (2011)

AB this PAPER_DESIGNS a multi_agent based framework for
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION in CONSTRUCTION_MANAGEMENT through adopting the
   AGENT_TECHNOLOGY and regarding the CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY_CHAIN as a
   TYPICAL_MULTIAGENT_SYSTEM. this FRAMEWORK_INTEGRATES the SPECIALTY_AGENTS
   (CONTRACTOR_AGENT, DESIGNER_AGENT, SUPPLIER_AGENT, OWNER_AGENT) and
   SERVICE_AGENTS (COORDINATOR_AGENT, MONITOR_AGENT, NAME_SERVER_AGENT) into a
   multi_agent SYSTEM through the INTERNET. since DIFFERENT_MEMBERS in the
   CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY_CHAIN have DIFFERENT_PREFERENCES on the
   DECISION_ATTRIBUTES (such as COST, time, quality, SAFETY and ENVIRONMENT), a
   multi_attribute NEGOTIATION_MECHANISM is established by constructing the
   multi_attribute NEGOTIATION_MODEL, describing the
   MULTIATTRIBUTE_NEGOTIATION_PROCESS, and designing the multi_attribute
   NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL. the establishment of this mechanism for CONSTRUCTION
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION is based on NEGOTIATION_THEORY and UTILITY_THEORY
   and aimed at promoting the COORDINATION between SPECIALTY_AGENTS in it.
   finally, the PROTOTYPE_SYSTEM is developed by using a multi_agent
   SYSTEM_DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT. the experiment indicates that can solve
   problems in the CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY_CHAIN_OPERATION and provides a solution

AB the MANAGEMENT and OPTIMIZATION of the CRISIS_MANAGEMENT SUPPLY_CHAIN is
   very complex and involves MULTIPLE_CONCEPTS: SUPPLY RESOURCES,
   PROBABILITY_AND_STATISTICS, means of TRANSPORTATION, disturbances on the
   DELIVERY_DATES, and the importance of decisions involving HUMAN lives.  to
   meet these requirements, multi_agent systems are a well_suited solution for
   MODELING the SUPPLY_CHAIN through INTERACTIVE_AUTONOMOUS_ENTITIES. our MODEL
   represents a distributed LOGISTIC_SYSTEM in which flows of RESOURCES are
   hierarchically forwarded from one zone to another, taking into account the
   randomness of RESOURCES' consumption.  the issue is then to optimize the
   PROCUREMENT_POLICY to avoid shortages that could cripple the WHOLE_SYSTEM.
   in this paper we propose the multi_agent TECHNOLOGY for MODELING the
   DIFFERENT_ACTORS of the LOGISTIC_CHAIN. then we propose an INNOVATIVE_METHOD
   to estimate the FUTURE_NEEDS in RESOURCES for every zone.  our FORECASTING
   method is based on FUZZY_CALCULATIONS combined to ARMAX_TIME_SERIES
   MODELLING. the OBJECTIVE of our work is to avoid, in a CRISIS_SITUATION,
   STOCK_OUTS by optimizing the ESTIMATION of the FUTURE_NEEDS in RESOURCES for
   each zone and balancing the flows throughout the SYSTEM.

AB realizing the DYNAMIC_NATURE of INFORMATION_FLOW and the conflicting
   objectives of members play VITAL_ROLE in EFFECTIVE_DESIGN of e_supply
   NETWORKS (e_sn). while there are some RESEARCH in the SN_LITERATURE
   proposing different dynamic and INTELLIGENT_COORDINATION_MECHANISMS, the
   impact of the PROPER_DEFINITION of DATA_STRUCTURE and long_term relationship
   in MODELING both COORDINATION and NEGOTIATION_MECHANISMS have not been
   addressed deeply.  in this paper, we propose three overlapping services
   including INTELLIGENT matching of partners, PROPOSAL_GENERATIONS, and
   long_term contract MANAGEMENT. the PROCESS begins with the selection of
   qualified partners based on the SIMILARITY of USERS_PROFILES in a
   MULTIDIMENSIONAL_SPACE defined by NETWORK_ATTRIBUTES. then, a
   COORDINATION_MECHANISM for long_term agreements is proposed such that the
   generated proposals in e_sn encourage buyers to reveal their DEMAND in
   advance.  the proposed MECHANISM_INTRODUCES the importance of
   STRATEGIC_BUYERS for SUPPLIERS in MODELING and DECISION_MAKING_PROCESS. to
   illustrate the MODEL_EFFICIENCY, a PROTOTYPE_SYSTEM has been modeled and is
   compared to the traditional tendering mechanism.  the VALIDATION_RESULTS
   confirm the MODEL_EFFICIENCY in providing long_term decisions in a

AB this paper presents a multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) to SUPPORT_PARTNER_SELECTION
   in a sustainable SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK. with the growing awareness of
   environmental and SOCIAL_ISSUES globally, governments and INDUSTRY have
   recognized that they have VITAL_ROLES in supporting and assuring
   SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT. in consideration of these concerns,
   COMPANIES_WORLDWIDE have begun to adopt SUSTAINABILITY_PRACTICES in the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. an IMPORTANT_ISSUE of SUSTAINABILITY_PRACTICES is to involve
   the SUSTAINABILITY_CONSIDERATIONS into organizational PURCHASING DECISION
   and LONG_TERM_RELATIONSHIPS with SUPPLIERS. that is, in the selection of
   SUPPLIERS and OUTSOURCING partners, ENTERPRISES should not only consider the
   GENERAL_CRITERIA, but also should consider the environmental and
   SOCIAL_IMPACTS of their partners.  EVALUATION and selection of partners is a
   typical multi_criteria DECISION_MAKING (MCDM) problem involving both
   qualitative and QUANTITATIVE_ISSUES. for the implementation of SUPPLY_CHAIN
   SUSTAINABILITY, issues regarding environmental and SOCIAL_RESPONSIBILITY are
   to be included in PARTNER_EVALUATION, in addition to the
   CONVENTIONAL_CRITERIA such as price, quality, delivery, and service.  in
   this paper, the MAS is established to integrate SUSTAINABILITY concerns into
   the SUPPLY_CHAIN_PARTNER_EVALUATION and SELECTION_PROCESS. AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS
   are established to represent VARIOUS_PARTIES and FUNCTIONS of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN, for instance, a BUYER_AGENT represents the buyer and the
   POTENTIAL_SUPPLIERS are represented by SELLER_AGENTS. the BUYER_AGENT has to
   EXCHANGE_BIDS with the SELLER_AGENTS on the MULTIPLE_CRITERIA repeatedly.
   the MAS is equipped with SUITABLE_NEGOTIATION_STRATEGIES and
   NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL to all AGENTS. it SUPPORTS_MULTILATERAL_NEGOTIATION,
   that is, the BUYER_AGENT is able to interact with many SELLER_AGENTS
   concurrently in the bidding PROCESS.  ifac.

   show how it realises the REAL_OPERATIONAL_INTERACTIONS between different
   SUPPLY_CHAIN partners under DEMAND_DISRUPTION. SIMULATION_RESULTS of the
   proposed MODELS reveal the evolution of the ctm SUPPLY_CHAIN with
   DEMAND_DISRUPTION. the DYNAMIC_DELIVERY_ABILITY and ORDER_POINT which are
   caused by DEMAND_DISRUPTION in the ctm SUPPLY_CHAIN are investigated.  the
   results indicate that ctm can significantly reduce COSTS and improve the
   FLEXIBILITY of COMPANIES in handling DEMAND_DISRUPTION_PROBLEMS. it is
   suggested that ctm is an EFFICIENT_MECHANISM to manage SUPPLY_CHAINS,

AB the long_term economic, environmental, and SOCIAL_SUSTAINABILITY of a food
   SUPPLY_CHAIN (fsc) depends upon the relationships and INTERACTIONS among ITS
   VARIOUS_ACTORS. multi_agent SIMULATION is a MODELING tool that allows
   goaldirected, AUTONOMOUS_BEHAVIORS of HETEROGENEOUS_ACTORS to be captured at
   the level of the individual.  these small_scale behaviors and
   INTERACTIONS_RESULT in observable emergent organizational_level OUTPUTS,
   providing a better understanding of the effects of DIFFERENT_FSC_STRUCTURES
   on long_term SUSTAINABILITY. in this paper, a new multi_agent
   SIMULATION_MODEL of an fsc is described, in which two
   DIFFERENT_REGIONAL_FSC_ACTOR_TYPES are constructed: farmers and a
   REGIONAL_FOOD_HUB. each actor is assigned attributes to represent ITS
   OPERATIONAL_STRATEGY and scale.  these ATTRIBUTES_CONTRIBUTE directly to the
   fsc'S OVERALL_PERFORMANCE over time, which is measured in terms of the
   percentage of the simulated region'S DEMAND for food that can be filled by
   REGIONAL_SOURCES, which is used as a proxy for economic and
   SOCIAL_SUSTAINABILITY. results are analyzed for STATISTICAL_SIGNIFICANCE,
   and implications for FSC_SUSTAINABILITY are discussed.  COMMON_GROUND,

AB in most MANUFACTURING COMPANIES, SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM) has been
   successfully utilized to reduce COSTS, reduce risk, and improve
   CUSTOMER_SATISFACTION. TYPICAL_SCM_APPROACHES are the cost_focused
   just_in_time (JIT) approach and the risk_focused just_in_sequence (JIS)
   approach.  despite some successes, these two SCM_APPROACHES have suffered
   from ad hoc mismanagement and FREQUENT_FAILURE due to HIGH_COSTS and
   UNCONTROLLED_RISKS. this paper proposes a NEW_SCM_APPROACH, DECENTRALIZED
   SCM, which incorporates multi_core tiers and PLATFORM_COMMONIZATION. to
   prove ITS validity, we have implemented a multi_agent SIMULATION (MAS)
   platform named massop (multi_agent simulation_based
   SCM_OPTIMIZATION_PLATFORM) in which a GENERAL_BAYESIAN_NETWORK (gbn) is used
   to build an INTELLIGENT_INFERENCE_MECHANISM to predict SALES and then feed
   this information back into the MAS_ENGINE to OPTIMIZE_SCM by reducing risk
   and COST. using a data set compiled over the course of 40 years by an
   AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING company as the basis for preparing the
   INITIAL_PARAMETERS for the MAS, massop was built using REPAST_SIMPHONY and
   then tested.  the results were promising, robust, and statistically valid
   when compared with JIT and JIS.  2012 springer_verlag.

AB abstract inspired by the NEW_ACHIEVEMENTS in MOBILE_ROBOTICS having as a
   result MOBILE_ROBOTS able to execute DIFFERENT_PRODUCTION_TASKS, we consider
   a factory producing a set of DISTINCT_PRODUCTS via or with the
   ADDITIONAL_HELP of MOBILE_ROBOTS. this particularly FLEXIBLE_LAYOUT requires
   the definition and the solution of a complex PLANNING and
   SCHEDULING_PROBLEM. in order to MINIMIZE_PRODUCTION_COSTS,
   DYNAMIC_DETERMINATION of the number of ROBOTS for each PRODUCTION_TASK and
   the INDIVIDUAL_ROBOT_ALLOCATION are needed.  we propose a solution in terms
   of a two_level DECENTRALIZED multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) framework: at the
   first, PRODUCTION_PLANNING_LEVEL, AGENTS are tasks which compete for ROBOTS
   (RESOURCES at this level); at the second, SCHEDULING_LEVEL, AGENTS are
   ROBOTS which reallocate themselves among DIFFERENT_TASKS to satisfy the
   requests coming from the first level.  an ITERATIVE_AUCTION based
   NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL is used at the first level while the second
   LEVEL_SOLVES a multi_robot TASK_ALLOCATION (mrta) problem through a

AB e_commerce is gradually changing the WAY_SHOPPERS acquire goods and
   services.  shoppers seek ways to PURCHASE_GOODS easily through the INTERNET,
   and shippers or producers offer CHEAP_WAYS to deliver goods to their
   CUSTOMERS through the services of carriers for HOME_DELIVERY. a
   THEORETICAL_MODEL was established to evaluate CITY_LOGISTICS_SCHEMES for
   MULTIPLE_STAKEHOLDERS before implementation.  POLICY_MEASURES to
   MANAGE_TRUCK_OPERATIONS in the CITY and keep POLLUTION_LEVELS at a minimum
   were evaluated.  cordon_based FREIGHT_ROAD PRICING was found to provide
   better POLLUTION_REDUCTION compared with distance_based PRICING, but
   cordon_based PRICING had less impact on areas outside a CITY. the problem
   was solved with a MODELING approach for MULTIAGENT_SYSTEMS that used a
   VEHICLE_ROUTING_PROBLEM with TIME_WINDOWS, FREIGHT ELECTRONIC_MARKETPLACES,
   and q_learning.

AB FINANCIAL_MARKETS are COMPLEX_SYSTEMS consisting of entities interacting and

   requires the use on the one hand of a suited TECHNOLOGY that is multi_agent
   systems (MASS) to MODEL the VARIOUS_ACTORS of a MARKET, and on the other
   hand the EVOLUTIONARY_GAME_THEORY to FORMALISE_INTERACTIONS and
   HETEROGENEOUS_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES. the goal of this paper is to MODEL,
   simulate and analyse FINANCIAL_MARKETS_DYNAMICS. for this purpose, we
   propose three MARKET_MODELS (fundamentalist, strategic, conventionalist)
   summarising VARIOUS_FACETS of REAL_MARKET_SPECULATION depending on the
   information held and the PRICE_FORMATION_PROCESS chosen by the investors.

AB green SUPPLY_CHAIN_ISSUES have attracted a lot of attention in RECENT_YEARS
   with growing awareness of ENVIRONMENTAL_CONCERNS. this has drawn the
   considerable world_wide attention of academics and practitioners.
   therefore, RECYCLING has now become an INTEGRAL_COMPONENT of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. RECYCLING of USED_PRODUCTS and the related
   LOGISTICS_MANAGEMENT_POSE a SIGNIFICANT_CHALLENGE to
   MANUFACTURING_INDUSTRIES. in order to resolve the COMPLEXITY of the task,
   this study proposes a multi_agent ARCHITECTURE to handle RECYCLING and
   REVERSE_LOGISTICS_ISSUES, which have so far been neglected.  it addresses
   the DIFFERENT_ASPECTS of RECYCLING such as WASTE_CLASSIFICATION, RECYCLING,
   LOGISTICS and REUSE of products.  additionally, it also discusses how the
   AGENT_COMMUNICATES and acts autonomously to facilitate the

   AGENT_ARCHITECTURE can assist MANUFACTURING_INDUSTRIES in efficiently
   managing their green SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM and COMPLEX_LOGISTICS_ISSUES.  2012

   on the use of INTELLIGENT_AGENTS capable of

AB SUPPLY_CHAINS are large_scale DISTRIBUTION_NETWORKS in which MULTIPLE_TYPES
   of commodities are present.  in this paper, the OPERATIONS_MANAGEMENT in
   SUPPLY_CHAINS is posed as a tracking CONTROL_PROBLEM. all INVENTORY_LEVELS
   in the network should be kept as close as possible to the desired values
   over time.  the SUPPLY_CHAIN_STATE is disturbed due to CLIENT_DEMAND at the
   END_NODES. a multi_agent CONTROL_ARCHITECTURE to restore all
   INVENTORY_LEVELS over the SUPPLY_CHAIN is proposed.  first the MODEL for the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN is broken down into smaller subsystems using a
   FLOW_DECOMPOSITION. the OPERATIONS_MANAGEMENT for each subsystem will be
   decided upon by a dedicated CONTROL_AGENT. the CONTROL_AGENTS solve their
   problems using a pull_flow perspective, starting at the END_NODES and then
   propagating upstream.  adding NEW_COMPONENTS to the SUPPLY_CHAIN will have
   as a consequence the inclusion of more CONTROL_AGENTS. the proposed
   ARCHITECTURE is easily scalable to large SUPPLY_CHAINS due to ITS modular
   feature.  the multi_agent CONTROL_ARCHITECTURE PERFORMANCE is illustrated
   using a SUPPLY_CHAIN composed of four levels (SUPPLIERS, consolidation,
   DISTRIBUTION, END_NODES) using DIFFERENT_LEVELS of predictions about
   CLIENT_DEMANDS. with the increase of PREDICTION_DEMAND_ACCURACY the proposed
   CONTROL_ARCHITECTURE is able to keep the desired INVENTORY_LEVEL at the
   END_NODES over time, which makes it suitable for use for just in
   TIME_PRODUCTION_STRATEGIES.  springer_verlag berlin heidelberg 2013.

   SUPPLY_CHAINS. the dynamic SUPPLY_CHAIN means the RETAILER can change his
   SUPPLIERS in every PURCHASE_PERIOD for more profits.  four categories of
   two_stage SUPPLY_CHAIN structures consisting of MULTIPLE_SUPPLIERS and a
   single RETAILER are considered.  two categories of AUCTION_MECHANISMS,
   single_winner or multi_winner AUCTION, are used in this paper.  a
   multi_agent MODEL is developed to study these four categories of
   SUPPLY_CHAINS. the results of EXPERIMENTS show that, with the decrease of

   DIFFERENT_STRUCTURES. also, the optimal (near_optimal) SAFETY_STOCK,
   corresponding to the MAXIMUM_PROFIT, shows SIGNIFICANT_DIFFERENCE under

AB a SUPPLY_CHAIN is a COMPLEX_ADAPTIVE_SYSTEM that is very difficult to
   analyze, in particular, with respect to ITS DYNAMICS, stochastic, and
   UNCERTAINTY. the TRADITIONAL_ANALYTICAL_MODEL is unable to cope with these
   characteristics of SUPPLY_CHAIN. in addition, the ANALYTICAL_MODEL may not
   be solved due to ITS COMPLEXITY and nonlinearity.  SIMULATION, especially
   the multi_agent_based DISTRIBUTED_SIMULATION, is one of the most
   EFFECTIVE_TOOLS to MODEL and analyze SUPPLY_CHAIN. in this paper, a
   multi_agent platform framework with multi_layers for MODELING and
   DISTRIBUTED_SIMULATION of the complex SUPPLY_CHAIN is presented.  in this
   platform, GENERIC_AGENTS for MODELING entities in SUPPLY_CHAIN are described
   and a NOVEL_SIMULATION MODELING approach enabled by the platform is
   proposed.  the platform provides a FLEXIBLE_ENVIRONMENT for defining,
   deploying, simulating, and displaying agent_based SIMULATION_MODELS and
   enables users to INSTANTIATE_GENERIC_AGENTS to MODEL their required
   SIMULATION_MODELS rapidly.  a three_echelon SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL is developed
   and simulated to illustrate the use of the SIMULATION_PLATFORM.  2011

   among SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS. the multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) TECHNOLOGY has
   provided the potential of automating SUPPLY_CHAIN negotiations to
   ALLEVIATE_HUMAN_INTERACTIONS. SOFTWARE_AGENTS are supposed to perform on

   NEGOTIATION_KNOWLEDGE utilized by AGENTS and FACILITATE_AGENTS'
   ADAPTIVE_NEGOTIATION_DECISION_MAKING_ABILITY, an ontology_based approach is
   proposed in this paper.  firstly, the multi_agent assisted SUPPLY_CHAIN
   NEGOTIATION_SCHEME is presented to configure the GENERAL_DESIGN_COMPONENTS
   of the NEGOTIATION_SYSTEM, covering the AGENT_INTELLIGENCE_MODULES, the

   NEGOTIATION_KNOWLEDGE is separated into shared NEGOTIATION_ONTOLOGY and

   the field of mechatronic.  the study is based on the analysis of the
   organisational features, the actors' behaviour, and
   PERFORMANCE_CONSIDERATIONS. the DEVELOPMENT of the MODEL_RELIES on an
   ITERATIVE_FRAMEWORK that progressively integrates DIFFERENT_ASPECTS into the
   MODEL. this framework is the ARCHMDE_PROCESS, which is based on mde
   (MODEL_DRIVEN engineering). a major feature of this work lies in ITS
   contribution to two DIFFERENT_AREAS of RESEARCH. the first contribution of
   the work is to propose a GENERIC_METAMODEL for scs.  based on a
   LITERATURE_REVIEW, an INCREMENTAL_FRAMEWORK is proposed for the MODELLING of
   scs in terms of concepts, structure and relationships.  the application of
   the framework to the studied context is described and ITS result is a
   domain_metamodel for scs.  the second contribution of this work lies in the
   FORMALISATION of the DYNAMIC_BEHAVIOUR of the concepts in the metamodel.
   this FORMALISATION is based on the MULTIAGENT_APPROACH. an AGENTIFICATION of
   the metamodel is thus drawn, thanks to the NATURAL_LINKS between
   MULTIAGENT_THEORY and SC_REALITY. this step leads to an
   agentified_domain_metamodel which also includes themonitoring of the SC and
   SYNCHRONISATION_PROTOCOLS. by adding relationships and
   DYNAMIC_BEHAVIOR_ASPECTS, we obtain a metamodel of the domain that can be
   implemented, with ITS static and DYNAMIC_ASPECTS. to validate this MODEL, an
   INDUSTRIAL_CASE_STUDY is detailed and has been instantiated and encoded in

AB in traditional SUPPLY_CHAIN (SC), PLANNING problems are usually considered
   individually at each SC_ENTITY. however, SUCH_DECISIONS often influence the
   other members in the CHAIN and thus an INTEGRATED_APPROACH should be
   considered.  by MODELLING system_wide SC_NETWORKS, DIFFERENT_SC_PROBLEMS,
   like PRODUCTION_PLANNING, COORDINATION, ORDER_DISTRIBUTION, among others,
   can be integrated and solved simultaneously so that the solution is
   beneficial to all entities in a long_term base.  in an attempt to make
   progress in this area, researchers use VARIOUS_METHODS for MODELLING the
   DYNAMICS of scs.  in the LITERATURE_REVIEW, due to their
   DISTINCTIVE_CHARACTERISTICS, multi_agent_based systems have emerged as one
   of the most adequate MODELLING TOOLS for tackling VARIOUS_ASPECTS of
   SC_PROBLEMS. in this work, a multi_agent SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM (mascs) MODEL
   that integrates DIFFERENT_SC_PROCESSES is presented.  the proposed MODEL
   allows MODELLING DIFFERENT_SCS with multi_products and
   DIFFERENT_OPERATIONAL_POLICIES considering INFORMATION_ASYMMETRY and
   distributed/DECENTRALIZED mode of CONTROL. in this ARTICLE the details of
   the MASCS_MODEL_DEVELOPMENT and implementation are presented.  furthermore,
   the applicability of the proposed mascs is briefly demonstrated through the
   solution of a SC_EXAMPLE. the obtained results are discussed and
   RESEARCH_EXTENSIONS are outlined.  ecms klaus g.  troitzsch, michael

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT is a very DYNAMIC_OPERATION_RESEARCH_PROBLEM where
   one has to quickly adapt according to the changes perceived in ENVIRONMENT
   in order to maximize the BENEFIT or minimize the loss.  therefore we require
   a SYSTEM which changes as per the changing requirements.
   MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM_TECHNOLOGY in RECENT_TIMES has emerged as a POSSIBLE_WAY
   of EFFICIENT_SOLUTION_IMPLEMENTATION for many SUCH_COMPLEX_PROBLEMS. our
   RESEARCH here focuses on building a MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM (MAS), which
   implements a modified version of
   GRAVITATIONAL_SEARCH_SWARM_INTELLIGENCE_ALGORITHM (gsa) to find out an
   OPTIMAL_STRATEGY in managing the DEMAND SUPPLY_CHAIN. we target the
   GRAINS_DISTRIBUTION_SYSTEM among VARIOUS_CENTERS of FOOD_CORPORATION of
   india (fci) as APPLICATION_DOMAIN. we assume centers with larger stocks as
   objects of greater MASS and VICE_VERSA. applying NEWTONIAN_LAW of gravity as
   suggested in gsa, larger objects attract objects of smaller MASS towards
   itself, creating a VIRTUAL_GRAIN SUPPLY source.  as heavier OBJECT_SHEDS ITS
   MASS by supplying some to the one in DEMAND, it loses ITS GRAVITATIONAL_PULL
   and thus keeps the WHOLE_SYSTEM of SUPPLY_CHAIN perfectly in balance.  the
   MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM helps in CONTINUOUS_UPDATION of the WHOLE_SYSTEM with the
   help of AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS which react to the change in ENVIRONMENT and act
   accordingly.  this MODEL also reduces the COMMUNICATION_BOTTLENECK to
   greater extents.  2012 SPRINGER_INDIA_PVT. ltd.

   associated with the PHARMACEUTICAL_INDUSTRY. we demonstrate that the

   SUPPLIERS, and 60 DISTRIBUTORS. three types of drugs, blockbusters, medium
   and small, with a 12_year lognormal PRODUCT_LIFE cycle are released by
   MANUFACTURERS. each quarter the DISTRIBUTORS bid for FUTURE_MARKET_SHARE of
   the released products, and the SUPPLIERS bid for ACCEPTABLE_MARGINS.

AB our goal was to develop an ENVIRONMENT which will make it possible to MODEL
   and optimise SUPPLY_CHAINS and COMPANY_BEHAVIOURS, as well as to test the
   influence of applying DIFFERENT_DECISION_ALGORITHMS. the SYSTEM consists of
   a set of COMPANIES which cooperate and compete with one another by offering
   and BUYING_PRODUCTS and negotiating their conditions of transactions.
   throughout the presented work we focused on the realisation of the parts of
   the STRATEGIC_PLANNER_MODULE. producers tend to MAXIMISE_PROFITS, among
   other ways, by modifying the margin of offered products.  the MAIN_AIM of
   the applied DECISION_ALGORITHM is to have a feature of adapting to a given
   situation: to select the best MODEL of the SIMULATION_WORLD and to choose
   the most ADEQUATE_ACTIONS in the given situations.  the first aspect is
   addressed by the use of an ADAPTIVE_ALGORITHM which chooses the best
   DEMAND_PREDICTION_ALGORITHM in a given situation.  the second aspect is
   addressed by the CLUSTERING TECHNIQUE which identifies the
   SIMILAR_SITUATIONS on the MARKET as one POSSIBLE_STATE and assigns with it

   these DISASTERS require a consequent quick and EFFICIENT_RESPONSE that
   depends on the ability of LOGISTICS_SYSTEMS to GENERATE_PLANS under a

   disaster.  the covered areas are geographically distributed and partitioned
   into multiple sub_regions.  each area is assigned a
   DELIVERY_SCHEDULING_SUB_PROBLEM. by employing a distributed
   COOPERATIVE_FRAMEWORK, we achieved an incorporation of
   VARIOUS_EVALUATION_PARAMETERS in the PROCESS of SCHEDULING in order to
   maintain a HIGH_LEVEL of SYNCHRONIZATION of all the SUPPLY_CHAIN, and so to

AB nowadays, the PERFORMANCE of CUSTOMER_SERVICE_LEVEL in
   MANUFACTURING_INDUSTRIES highly depends on an effective
   MANUFACTURING_PLANNING and CONTROL_SYSTEM (mpcs). an agent_based
   MANUFACTURING_PLANNING and CONTROL_SYSTEM (ampcs) allows negotiation_based
   decision_making to achieve the GLOBAL_OBJECTIVE. with the advantage of
   RADIO_FREQUENCY_IDENTIFICATION (RFID) TECHNOLOGY, AGENTS in ampcs may
   effectively CONTROL and identify the PRODUCTION_PROGRESS of all
   RAW_MATERIALS, work_in_progress (wip), and products across the entire
   MANUFACTURING SUPPLY_CHAIN. however, the PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE may become
   inefficient or even infeasible due to uncertainties, such as
   MACHINE_BREAKDOWNS, PROCESSING_TIME_DELAYS, RUSH_ORDER, QUALITY_PROBLEMS,
   and UNAVAILABLE_MATERIAL. therefore, this RESEARCH proposes a closed_loop
   FEEDBACK SIMULATION (clfs) approach based on rfid_enabled real_time
   MANUFACTURING information for SCHEDULING and rescheduling in an agent_based
   MANUFACTURING_SYSTEM in response to the dynamically changing MANUFACTURING
   activities and exceptions.  from the SIMULATION_EXPERIMENT, the
   SCHEDULING_RESULTS proposed by rfid_based mpcs combined with clfs performed
   much better than the results obtained from PREVIOUS_RESEARCHES.copyright

AB in SUPPLY_CHAINS of PETROLEUM_INDUSTRY, maintaining a PROPER_INVENTORY_LEVEL
   for MULTIPLE_PETROLEUM_PRODUCTS is a CRUCIAL_ISSUE. basically, this CHAIN
   has several elements like PRODUCER_BASES, CONSUMER_BASES and terminals that
   are linked by means of a multi_modal TRANSPORT_NETWORK. these elements must
   cooperate to achieve the GLOBAL_GOAL of the SYSTEM with a minimized COST. to
   achieve this goal, this paper presents a MULTIAGENT_PROTOCOL for

AB agent_based TECHNOLOGY and ITS APPLICATIONS in multi_agent systems are a set
   of TOOLS used in many sectors, including MANUFACTURING, services, LOGISTICS,
   and HEALTH_CARE, to MODEL and study the DYNAMICS, RESILIENCE, and
   self_organization of COMPLEX_SYSTEMS, as well as to
   DESIGN_PRESCRIPTIVE_DECISION_SUPPORT_SYSTEMS. agent_based
   TECHNOLOGY_ENCOMPASSES VARIOUS_TECHNIQUES from distributed
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE and is sometime used in conjunction with
   OPERATIONS_RESEARCH to MODEL and simulate how SYSTEM_COMPONENTS_BEHAVE and
   interact.  these techniques are also used to assess the impact of
   regulations and ORGANIZATIONAL_CONSTRAINTS on the ability of systems to
   self_organize and adapt to changes.  because this TECHNOLOGY can MODEL a
   WIDE_RANGE of behaviours, including reactive, proactive/PLANNING, and
   LEARNING, as well as INTERACTION_MECHANISMS such as COMPETITION and
   COLLABORATION, agent_based TECHNOLOGY has been used in many APPLICATIONS in
   the FOREST_SECTOR and the FOREST_PRODUCTS_INDUSTRY, ranging from
   ECOSYSTEM_SIMULATION, TERRITORIAL_PLANNING, FIRE_MANAGEMENT, and
   OPERATIONS_MANAGEMENT to SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. this paper proposes a
   SURVEY of these APPLICATIONS and identifies how AGENT_TECHNOLOGY is used to
   develop advanced TOOLS to achieve a better understanding of the biological,
   social, and ECONOMIC_DYNAMICS of FOREST_ECOSYSTEMS, as well as to improve
   decision_making in TERRITORIAL_PLANNING, LAND_USE, and PRODUCTION and

AB with the increasing INTERDEPENDENCE among SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS on material,
   information and CAPITAL, INTERACTIONS and decisions characterized by
   OPERATIONAL_PARAMETERS are IMPORTANT_CAUSES of BANKRUPTCY_PROPAGATION in
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. this PAPER_INVESTIGATES the methods for mitigating
   BANKRUPTCY_PROPAGATION through SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION. based on a
   two_stage SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK that consists of
   MULTIPLE_UPSTREAM_MANUFACTURERS and multiple downstream RETAILERS, the
   effectiveness of some TYPICAL_CONTRACTUAL_INCENTIVE_SCHEMES, including
   revenue SHARING, PRICE_DISCOUNT and QUANTITY_FLEXIBILITY_CONTRACTS, in
   mitigating BANKRUPTCY_PROPAGATION among SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS is examined.
   through agent_based SIMULATION_EXPERIMENTS, it has been revealed that: 1)
   the three typical SUPPLY_CHAIN CONTRACTS with properly designed
   CONTRACT_PARAMETERS are effective in mitigating BANKRUPTCY_PROPAGATION, but
   their effectiveness depends on OPERATIONAL_PARAMETERS of the SUPPLY_CHAIN;
   2) HORIZONTAL_COMPETITION among RETAILERS is an IMPORTANT_FACTOR in
   determining the effectiveness of these CONTRACTS; 3) revenue SHARING
   contract turns out to be more effective in mitigating BANKRUPTCY_PROPAGATION
   than the other two CONTRACTS. by comparing the OPTIMAL_CONTRACT_PARAMETERS
   with and without considering BANKRUPTCY_RISKS, it has also been found that,
   a set of CONTRACT_PARAMETERS that can maximize the profit of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN may increase the occurrence of BANKRUPTCY in SUPPLY_CHAIN,
   leading to the phenomenon of a risk_profit tradeoff.  2012 elsevier b.v.

AB in light of the pressures of increasing demands on EARTH'S RESOURCES,

   SUPPLY_CHAIN (fsc) MODELS are critically important, providing
   decision_makers with TOOLS that allow for the EVALUATION and DESIGN of fscs,
   EN_ROUTE to ensuring SUSTAINABLE_FSC_PRODUCTIVITY. multi_agent SIMULATION
   (MAS) is well_suited to MODELING fscs for this purpose, enabling capture of
   decision_making, INTERACTIONS, and adaptations of AUTONOMOUS_FSC_ACTORS.
   however, CERTAIN_CHARACTERISTICS of fscs are particularly difficult to MODEL
   in detail, as DATA_REQUIREMENTS can be intensive.  in this paper we
   highlight some of the challenges modelers face in deciding the most
   APPROPRIATE_METHODS for representing the elements of an fsc in an MAS_MODEL.
   we provide examples from the literature that show how other modelers have
   chosen to address these challenges.  finally, we discuss benefits and
   limitations of each example'S approach, in terms of realism and

AB organizations have made a SIGNIFICANT_EFFORT to implement software for
   PLANNING_AND_SCHEDULING, but DISRUPTIVE_EVENT_MANAGEMENT is still a problem
   to be solved.  since a DISRUPTIVE_EVENT can affect the OVERALL_PERFORMANCE
   of the SUPPLY_CHAIN, SCEM (SUPPLY_CHAIN EVENT_MANAGEMENT) systems presenting
   DIFFERENT_AUTOMATION_LEVELS such as MONITORING, alarm and DECISION_SUPPORT
   have been proposed.  however, the MANAGEMENT of DISRUPTIVE_EVENTS, taking
   into account the distributed nature of the SUPPLY_CHAIN, the
   MEMBERS_AUTONOMY and the ability to exert CORRECTIVE_CONTROL_ACTIONS, has
   been identified as a problem that requires further RESEARCH. this work
   presents an agent_based approach for the SCEM_PROBLEM, which can perform
   AUTONOMOUS_CORRECTIVE_CONTROL_ACTIONS to minimize the effect of deviations
   in the plan that is currently being executed.  these CONTROL_ACTIONS_CONSIST
   of a DISTRIBUTION of the variation between SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS, using the
   PLANS_SLACK in a COLLABORATIVE_WAY. an innovative feature of this approach
   is ITS focus on RESOURCES, which are affected by DISRUPTIVE_EVENTS in a
   DIRECT_WAY. based on this approach, a SCEM_SYSTEM is designed as a net of
   CONTROL_POINTS defined on RESOURCES connected through SUPPLY PROCESS_ORDERS.
   two NOVEL_ASPECTS are the distributed COLLABORATIVE inter_organizational
   ARCHITECTURE of the SCEM_SYSTEM and a DOUBLE_CONTRACT_NET_PROTOCOL. this
   PROTOCOL allows a set of resource:representing AGENTS to interact through an
   AGENT, representing a SUPPLY_PROCESS_ORDER as a mediator.  an application to
   a CASE_STUDY of the multi_agent SCEM_SYSTEM implemented with JADE is

AB this ARTICLE presents an optimisation_based multi_agent DECISION_SUPPORT
   platform (dsopp) for integrated ORDER_PROMISING and PRODUCTION_PLANNING in a
   multi_enterprise SUPPLY_NETWORK ENVIRONMENT. the DSOPP_PLATFORM may be run
   either in REAL_TIME or in SIMULATION_MODE. ITS goal is to demonstrate the
   VIABILITY of COLLABORATIVE_DECISION_MAKING. the DSOPP_FRAMEWORK is built
   around a scalable multi_period OPTIMISATION_MODEL that may be used across
   ENTERPRISES. we first discuss the OPTIMISATION_MODEL at the core of the
   PLANNING_FUNCTION called the 'advanced ORDER_PLANNING' MODEL. we then
   present the DSOPP_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE, which consists of a distributed
   NETWORK_CONTROL_CENTRE (dncc) and individual SUPPLY_CHAIN CONTROL centres.
   INTELLIGENT_AGENTS are embedded in both types of centres.  the role of the
   dncc is to coordinate the PLANNING_CYCLE_CLOCK and facilitate the
   TRANSFER_OF_INFORMATION and INVENTORY through a CENTRAL_MAILBOX_MECHANISM.
   an individual SUPPLY_CHAIN centre comprises AGENTS for DEMAND_MANAGEMENT,
   PLANNING and PRODUCTION_EXECUTION. results from an EXPERIMENTAL_CASE
   indicate that the ideas presented in this ARTICLE can be used effectively to
   coordinate the PLANNING_ACTIVITIES across SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS by providing
   the ability to analyse and understand the effects of various SUPPLY_CHAIN
   parameters.  2010 taylor & francis.

AB MODULAR_CONSTRUCTION is COMMON_PRACTICE for building INDUSTRIAL_PLANTS in
   the ALBERTA_OIL_SANDS_REGION, canada because of the savings in COST and
   SCHEDULE, and improving SAFETY and quality.  each module represents a
   UNIQUE_CONSTRUCTION_PROJECT. thus, MODULAR_CONSTRUCTION is considered as
   multi_project CONSTRUCTION. SCHEDULING and EFFECTIVE_ALLOCATION of RESOURCES
   (e.g., space, SKILLED_CREW, CONSTRUCTION_EQUIPMENT) in such large_scale
   CONSTRUCTION_PROJECTS is a CHALLENGING_PROCESS. the PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE is
   expected to satisfy NUMEROUS_UNCERTAIN_FACTORS and constraints posed by the
   SITE_LAYOUT, RESOURCE_LIMITATIONS, the CONSTRUCTION_PROCESS, and various
   SUPPLY_CHAINS (e.g., SPOOL_FABRICATION_SHOP). traditional network_based
   SCHEDULING_APPROACHES are ineffective in SCHEDULING the multi_project
   ENVIRONMENT of MODULAR_CONSTRUCTION and OPTIMUM_ALLOCATION of RESOURCES.
   this paper presents a HYBRID_APPROACH based on DISCRETE_EVENT_SIMULATION
   MODELING and multi_agent RESOURCE_ALLOCATION (mara) for
   SCHEDULING_MODULAR_CONSTRUCTION. modules represent AGENTS who bid for
   RESOURCES (e.g., space in the yard) to maximize their INDIVIDUAL_WELFARE. an
   auctioneer is also designed who allocates the AVAILABLE_RESOURCES to the
   bidding AGENTS by maximizing the OVERALL_WELFARE of the society of AGENTS.
   the auctioneer can employ VARIOUS_COMBINATORIAL_OPTIMIZATION_ALGORITHMS
   (greedy and ascending_auction ALGORITHMS in this study) to allocate the
   RESOURCES to the AGENTS. AUCTIONS are held regularly until the end of the
   SIMULATION_MODEL to allocate the RESOURCES among AGENTS. this paper also
   presents the SUCCESSFUL_IMPLEMENTATION of this approach in an
   ACTUAL_CASE_STUDY of a MODULE_ASSEMBLY_YARD.  2010 ieee.

   reach agreements and establish FAIR_CONTRACTS where each actor is
   remunerated according to his added_value in the CHAIN. to handle the

   multi_agent MODELS. a first MODEL (m1) where a RETAILER_AGENT_NEGOTIATES
   several combinations (price, quantity) with the
   DIFFERENT_SUBCONTRACTOR_AGENTS. then, we present a second MODEL (m2) where
   we have a RETAILER_AGENT negotiating with several SUBCONTRACTOR_AGENTS, but
   we have also a FAIR_AGENT who tries to provide some FAIRNESS_GUIDANCE in the
   NEGOTIATION_PROCESS in order to rebalance the NEGOTIATION and guide the
   negotiators to the fairest POSSIBLE_NEGOTIATION. several experimentations
   have been made to compare results of the two MODELS.

AB in this paper, the focus is on the DYNAMIC_CONTROL_CARD in a CONWIP_SYSTEM.
   an approach to set the number of cards in order to adapt to the change of
   the PRODUCTION_SYSTEMS both in terms of external change as the DEMAND and
   internal change as the WORK_TIME of the machine, failures and so on.  a
   MULTI_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE is proposed to implement a flexible and
   EXTENSIBLE_APPROACH that can be implemented in a SUPPLY_CHAIN and not only
   in a single MANUFACTURING_SYSTEM. then, a set of RULES is proposed to change
   the number of cards in the SYSTEM. a DYNAMIC_SIMULATION_ENVIRONMENT has been
   developed to test the CONTROL_APPROACH under DIFFERENT_DYNAMIC_STATES. the
   PERFORMANCE_MEASURES evaluated are the AVERAGE_UTILIZATION of the
   MANUFACTURING_SYSTEM, the THROUGHPUT_TIME, THROUGHPUT, work in PROCESS and
   AVERAGE_AVAILABLE_CARDS. the proposed approach is compared with a
   KANBAN_CONTROL.  2010 JORDAN_JOURNAL of mechanical and

AB INFORMATION_SYSTEMS tend to be huger and of STRATEGIC_IMPORTANCE in
   NOWADAYS_BUISNESSES. that is why SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING is no more only a
   domain for MIDDLE_MANAGERS and software engieering professionals but
   TOP_MANAGERS require RICH_MODELS leading to visions on which they can
   perform STRATEGIC_ANALYSIS for determining their adequacy with
   LONG_TERM_OBJECTIVES. the I* approach with ITS social MODELING capabilities
   as well as SERVICE_ORIENTED_MODELING are part of this effort.  the
   STRATEGIC_SERVICES_MODEL combines those two approaches and defines a couple
   of ENVIRONMENTAL_FACTORS (namely threats and opportunities) enabling
   STRATEGIC_REASONING on the bases of the ENTERPRISE "high_level"
   ADDED_VALUES. such a framework offers the ADEQUATE_AGREGATION_LEVEL for
   enabling TOP_MANAGERS to take the adequate long TERM_DECISIONS for
   INFORMATION_SYSTEMS_DEVELOPMENT. the aim of this paper is to illustrate the
   STRATEGIC_SERVICES_MODEL_APPLICATION as well as a STRATEGIC_REASONING in the
   context of the DEVELOPMENT of a COLLABORATIVE_SOFTWARE_APPLICATION for
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. this CASE_STUDY is from PARTICULAR_INTEREST since
   it must be adopted by several actors played by cooperating or competing
   COMPANIES that have to figure out the consequences of the adoption of
   SUCH_SOFTWARE.

AB multi_agent systems (MASS) have emerged as the most
   NATURAL_INTRINSIC_PARADIGM for MODELLING COMPLEX_SYSTEMS, such as
   SUPPLY_CHAINS (scs). however, their DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS remains quite
   involved and extremely time consuming, hindering wide_spread adoption in
   industrial_strength APPLICATIONS. a SOFTWARE_AGENTCOMPONENT based framework
   is proposed to simplify and speedup multi_agent (ma)
   MODELLING_AND_SIMULATION for SC_APPLICATIONS. with the help of pre_developed
   LIBRARIES of reusable COMPONENTS _ organizational AGENTS (oas), SC_AGENTS
   (scas), behaviour and POLICY_OBJECTS; the framework allows MODEL_DEVELOPERS
   to quickly configure a MAS to SIMULATE_SC_DYNAMICS and STUDY_CONTROL and
   COORDINATION_ISSUES. being generic, flexible, and scalable; it
   SUPPORTS_DEVELOPMENT of either pseudo_centralized MODELS by a single
   MODEL_DEVELOPER, or distributed MODELS by either a single or group of
   ENTERPRISES constituting a SC. the framework is unique; based on
   requirements it allows for representing DIFFERENT_SEGMENTS of SC_NETWORK at
   either aggregated or detailed levels resulting in MODELS of
   HYBRID_RESOLUTION. it FACILITATES_STUDIES involving intra_and
   inter_organizational DYNAMICS (either independently or collectively),
   considering INFORMATION_ASYMMETRY explicitly.  the framework is validated
   through ma_simulation of TAMAGOTCHI_SC. ITS results are presented, and the

   COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGES in today'S UNCERTAIN_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENTS. there is
   STRONG_EVIDENCE of success in the SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE in cases with
   HIGH_COORDINATION among echelons.  the BULLWHIP_EFFECT is an
   IMPORTANT_PHENOMENON of AMPLIFICATION of DEMAND in SUPPLY_CHAIN. by
   eliminating the BULLWHIP_EFFECT, it is possible to increase
   PRODUCT_PROFITABILITY. REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (rl) is successfully applied
   to some dynamical and UNPREDICTABLE_ISSUES. by surveying some efficient
   multi_agent rl MECHANISMS, this paper presents a multi_layer ordering
   CONTROL_STRATEGY by a multi_agent COORDINATION_MODEL with RL_MECHANISM for
   alleviating, effectively and efficiently, the BULLWHIP_EFFECT of a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN with MULTIPLE_MEMBERS and MULTI_COMMODITIES. as an improvement
   to PREVIOUS_WORKS using rl in SUPPLY_CHAIN ordering MANAGEMENT_DOMAIN, the
   method presented in this paper can be used to deal with MULTIPLE_MEMBERS
   with MULTI_COMMODITIES in each echelon and each player.  as a result, the
   METHODOLOGY presented in this study is expected to help ADDRESS_ISSUES
   regarding the UNCERTAINTY and COMPLEXITY of deriving the MAXIMAL_PROFIT

AB we study a drop_shipping SUPPLY_CHAIN in which the RETAILER receives a
   customer'S order and the SUPPLIER_FILLS it.  in such a CHAIN, the supplier
   keeps INVENTORY and BEARS_INVENTORY_RISKS; the RETAILER_FOCUSES on MARKETING
   and CUSTOMER_ACQUISITION, and forwards the orders to the supplier.  the
   RETAILER usually has better CUSTOMER_DEMAND_INFORMATION, and may send an
   over_estimated DEMAND_FORECAST to maximize her OWN_INTEREST, which may
   result in overstock for the supplier.  on the other hand, since the RETAILER
   does not OWN_INVENTORY, the MAIN_CONCERN of the RETAILER is that the
   acquired orders may not be fulfilled because of the supplier'S shortage of
   stock.  to cope with these challenges, we propose a menu of
   commitment_penalty CONTRACTS that can provide greater certainty of DEMAND as
   well as greater certainty of SUPPLY. we focus our study in the
   ASYMMETRIC_DEMAND_INFORMATION_CASE and we show that the supplier can obtain
   the RETAILER'S DEMAND_INFORMATION by offering a menu of commitment_penalty
   CONTRACTS. under this mechanism, we find the solution that maximizes the

   GLOBAL_COMPETITION and CUSTOMERS who NEED_FOCALIZATION. therefore,
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS are becoming more dynamic and turbulent than ever
   before.  the DISTRIBUTION_CENTRE (dc) is an IMPORTANT_NODE in a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK in maintaining the flow of goods and materials among
   MANUFACTURERS and CUSTOMERS. the capability of the dc to maintain the same
   level of PERFORMANCE in a highly DYNAMIC_SCENARIO allows improvement of the
   COMPETITIVENESS of the SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK. the focus of this chapter is on
   the allocation of CUSTOMERS to the dcs in very DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENTS. a

   ARCHITECTURE: CUSTOMERS and DISTRIBUTION_CENTRES. the implementation of the
   MAS_ARCHITECTURE was developed using the JAVA_DEVELOPMENT_KIT; this platform
   was used to perform a DISCRETE_EVENT_SIMULATION and test the proposed

AB in this study we examine the relationship between SUPPLY_NETWORK'S TOPOLOGY
   and ITS ROBUSTNESS in the presence of RANDOM_FAILURES and targeted attacks.
   the agent_based MODEL developed in this PAPER_USES the BASIC_FRAMEWORK and
   parameters in the EXPERIMENTAL_GAME presented in sterman [1989, MODELING
   MANAGERIAL_BEHAVIOR: misperceptions of FEEDBACK in a
   DYNAMIC_DECISION_MAKING_CONTEXT. MANAGEMENT_SCIENCE, 35 (3), 321_339] for
   MODELLING ADAPTIVE_MANAGERIAL_DECISION_MAKING in an
   INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT_CONTEXT. the study extends the linear
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_CONTEXT to a complex SUPPLY_NETWORK and undertakes a
   RIGOROUS_EXAMINATION of ROBUSTNESS of these SUPPLY_NETWORKS that are
   characterised by DISTINCT_NETWORK_CHARACTERISTICS. we theorise that
   NETWORK_CHARACTERISTICS such as AVERAGE_PATH_LENGTH, CLUSTERING coefficient,
   size of the largest connected COMPONENT in the network and the
   MAXIMUM_DISTANCE between nodes in the largest connected COMPONENT are
   related to the ROBUSTNESS of SUPPLY_NETWORKS, and test the
   RESEARCH_HYPOTHESES using data from several SIMULATION_RUNS. SIMULATIONS
   were carried out using 20 DISTINCT_NETWORK_TOPOLOGIES where 10 of these
   topologies were generated using PREFERENTIAL_ATTACHMENT_APPROACH (based on
   the THEORY of scale_free NETWORKS) and the remaining 10 topologies were
   generated using RANDOM_ATTACHMENT_APPROACH (using RANDOM_GRAPH_THEORY as a
   foundation). these 20 SUPPLY_NETWORKS were subjected to RANDOM_DEMAND and
   their performances were evaluated by considering varying probabilities of
   RANDOM_FAILURES of nodes and targeted attacks on nodes.  we also consider
   the severity of these DISRUPTIONS by considering the downtime of the
   affected nodes.  using the data collected from a series of
   SIMULATION_EXPERIMENTS, we test the RESEARCH_HYPOTHESES by means of
   BINOMIAL_LOGISTIC_REGRESSION_ANALYSIS. the results point towards a
   SIGNIFICANT_ASSOCIATION between NETWORK_CHARACTERISTICS and SUPPLY_NETWORK
   ROBUSTNESS assessed using MULTIPLE_PERFORMANCE_MEASURES. we discuss the
   implications of the study and PRESENT_DIRECTIONS for FUTURE_RESEARCH.  2011

AB to improve the SUPPLY_CHAINS_PERFORMANCE under DEMAND_UNCERTAINTY and
   exceptions, VARIOUS_LEVELS of COLLABORATION_TECHNIQUES based on
   INFORMATION_SHARING were set up in real SUPPLY_CHAINS (vendor_managed
   INVENTORY, CONTINUOUS_REPLENISHMENT_PROGRAM, COLLABORATIVE_PLANNING,
   FORECASTING and REPLENISHMENT (CPFR),..). the MAIN_PRINCIPLE of these
   methods is that the RETAILERS do not need to place orders because
   wholesalers use INFORMATION_CENTRALIZATION to decide when to replenish them.
   although these techniques could be extended to a whole SUPPLY_CHAIN,
   CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATIONS ONLY_WORK between two BUSINESS_PARTNERS. with these
   techniques, COMPANIES electronically exchange a series of written comments
   and supporting data, which includes PAST_SALES_TRENDS, scheduled promotions,
   and FORECASTS. this allows participants to coordinate joint FORECASTING by
   focusing on differences in FORECASTS. but if the SUPPLY_CHAIN consists of
   AUTONOMOUS_ENTERPRISES, SHARING information becomes a CRITICAL_OBSTACLE,
   since each INDEPENDENT_ACTOR is typically not willing to share with the
   other nodes ITS OWN_STRATEGIC_DATA (as INVENTORY_LEVELS). that is why
   researchers proposed DIFFERENT_METHODS and INFORMATION_SYSTEMS to let the
   members of the SUPPLY_CHAIN_COLLABORATE without SHARING all their
   CONFIDENTIAL_DATA and information.  in this chapter we analyze some of the
   existing approaches and work and describe an agent_based distributed
   ARCHITECTURE for the decision_making PROCESS. the AGENTS in this
   ARCHITECTURE_USE a set of NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOLS (such as FIRM_HEURISTIC,
   RECURSIVE_HEURISTIC, CPFR_NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL) to collectively make
   decisions in a SHORT_TIME. the ARCHITECTURE has been validated on an

AB TRADITIONAL_NEGOTIATION, conducted face_to_face and via mail or TELEPHONE,
   is often difficult to manage, prone to misunderstanding, and time consuming.
   negotiators are typically satisfied with the FINAL_OUTCOME and, in many
   instances, proudly describe it.  however, closer inspection usually reveals
   that money is squandered, RESOURCES wasted, and POTENTIAL_JOINT_GAIN
   untapped.  AUTOMATED_NEGOTIATION promises a higher level of
   PROCESS_EFFICIENCY, and more importantly, a faster EMERGENCE and a higher
   quality of agreements.  the POTENTIAL_MONETARY_IMPACT has led to an
   increasing DEMAND for systems composed of SOFTWARE_AGENTS representing
   individuals or organizations and capable of reaching EFFICIENT_AGREEMENTS
   (e.g., the INDUSTRIAL_TREND toward agent_based SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT).
   work to date on AUTOMATED_NEGOTIATION has generated many USEFUL_IDEAS and
   concepts leading to IMPORTANT_THEORIES and systems.  yet, the field is still
   immature.  the DESIGN of SOFTWARE_AGENTS with NEGOTIATION_COMPETENCE largely
   LACKS_SYSTEMATIC, traceable, and REPRODUCIBLE_APPROACHES, and thus remains
   more an art than a science.  against this background, this paper presents a
   MODEL for SOFTWARE_AGENTS that handles two_party and multi_issue
   NEGOTIATION, manages IMPORTANT_ACTIVITIES that negotiators often perform
   before starting to negotiate, and FORMALIZES_RELEVANT_PROCEDURES studied in
   the SOCIAL_SCIENCES and frequently used in real_life NEGOTIATION. the
   MODEL_INCORPORATES VARIOUS_STRATEGIES and tactics.  strategies are
   computationally TRACTABLE_FUNCTIONS that define the tactics to be used both
   at the beginning and during the course of NEGOTIATION. they are based on
   rules_of_thumb distilled from BEHAVIORAL_PRACTICE in HUMAN_NEGOTIATION.
   tactics, in turn, are FUNCTIONS that specify the short_term moves to be made
   at each point of NEGOTIATION. they are structured, directed, and driven by
   STRATEGIC_CONSIDERATIONS. copyright  2010_11 by ijai (CESER_PUBLICATIONS).

AB with the increasing INTERDEPENDENCE among SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS, BANKRUPTCY
   of a SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBER may cause other MEMBER_FIRMS to get into
   FINANCIAL_DIFFICULTIES. this PAPER_INVESTIGATES the methods for reducing the
   PROBABILITY of BANKRUPTCY through SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION. based on the
   developed MULTIAGENT_SIMULATION_MODEL for a simple three_echelon
   SUPPLY_CHAIN, the effects of COORDINATION_MECHANISMS, such as
   INFORMATION_SHARING (ins) and vendor_managed INVENTORY (vmi), on reducing
   the occurrence of BANKRUPTCY at each stage of the SUPPLY_CHAIN are examined.
   SIMULATION_RESULTS show that SUCH_COORDINATION_MECHANISMS are effective in
   reducing the risk of BANKRUPTCY. however, the KEY_ROLES of these
   COORDINATION_MECHANISMS, e.g., the manufacturer in vmi and the RETAILER in
   ins, may be reluctant to cooperate since they gain less BENEFIT or even
   suffer a loss from the COORDINATION.
   ADDITIONAL_COOPERATION_INCENTIVE_MEASURES, I.e., PERMISSIBLE_DELAY in
   payment for ins and INVENTORY_SUBSIDY for vmi, are thus proposed for the
   implementation of these COORDINATION_MECHANISMS, and SIMULATION_RESULTS
   confirm their validity.  2009 ieee.

AB computer_supported SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM) has helped
   BUSINESS_PARTNERS to significantly improve their COOPERATION and
   COLLABORATION along the PRODUCT_LIFECYCLE. there is plenty of reported
   evidence that suggest inter_firm SCM have helped SPEED_UP the CYCLE_TIME and
   reduce LOGISTICS_INEFFICIENCIES. however, even with the
   SIGNIFICANT_IMPROVEMENT in internetdriven and inter_firm SCM technologies
   for supporting make_toorder PRODUCTION, it is not always possible to satisfy
   the availableto_ promise (atp) and capable_to_promise (ctp) requirements.
   this is typically due to the untimely and UNMATCHED_PRODUCTION_CAPACITY to
   CUSTOMER_DEMAND leading to dissatisfaction from the CUSTOMERS and the
   SUPPLIERS. we describe a multi_agent_based ARCHITECTURE for automated
   multi_attribute NEGOTIATION in ORDER_PROMISING to help search for
   NEW_SOLUTIONS until a SATISFACTORY_SOLUTION is found.  we embed
   multi_attribute multi_utility SIMULATIONS into a LINEAR_PROGRAM to search
   for a negotiated SOLUTIONS when a typical atp/ctp function of a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM_FORCES a rejection of a CUSTOMER_ORDER.

   in the MARKET. the MAIN_STRENGTH of the SYSTEM lies in the ability of the
   DEMAND_AGENT to predict customer winning BID_PRICES _ the highest prices the
   AGENT can offer CUSTOMERS and still obtain their orders.  this

AB effective SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM) COMPRISES_ACTIVITIES involving the
   DEMAND and SUPPLY of RESOURCES and services.  one IMPORTANT_ASPECT of SCM is
   that COMPANIES in the SUPPLY_CHAIN may have to make decisions which are
   conflicting with the other partners.  NEGOTIATION is an ESSENTIAL_APPROACH
   to solve transaction and SCHEDULING_PROBLEMS among SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS.
   multi_agent systems (MAS) are being increasingly used in SCM_APPLICATIONS.
   the advances in AGENT_TECHNOLOGY have provided the potential of automating
   SUPPLY_CHAIN negotiations to ALLEVIATE_HUMAN_INTERACTIONS. this paper
   proposes an ontology_mediated approach to organize the agent_based
   SUPPLY_CHAIN NEGOTIATION and equip the AGENTS with
   SOPHISTICATED_NEGOTIATION_KNOWLEDGE. firstly, a
   GENERIC_AGENT_NEGOTIATION_SCHEME is developed involving the
   AGENT_INTELLIGENCE_MODULES, the KNOWLEDGE_REPRESENTATION_METHOD and the
   INTERACTION_BEHAVIORS. then, the NEGOTIATION_KNOWLEDGE is structured through
   the usage of ONTOLOGY, which performs as a HIERARCHICAL_ARCHITECTURE as well
   as a DESCRIPTIVE_LANGUAGE. the relationships between
   NEGOTIATION_ONTOLOGY_CONCEPTS are defined through SWRL_INFERENCE_RULES.
   through this method, AGENTS' NEGOTIATION_BEHAVIORS will be more adaptive to

AB COOPERATIVE_GAME is an approach for a group of decision_making AGENTS (dmas)
   to reach mutually BENEFICIAL_AGREEMENTS where the players make agreements in
   order to optimize their COMMON_COST or payment.  a COORDINATION_MECHANISM is
   required to achieve a rational and structured plan for a DECISION jointly
   made by INDEPENDENT_DMAS. this paper presents a COOPERATIVE_GAME for the
   problem of COLLABORATIVE_PLANNING where each PLANNING domain is controlled
   by a dma.  the MAIN_PURPOSE here is to demonstrate how the
   COOPERATIVE_GAME_THEORY can be applied to the problem of multi_agent
   COLLABORATIVE_PLANNING. it deals with COST_ALLOCATION_METHODS which is
   basically an OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEM. we present several
   COORDINATION_MECHANISMS for the GAME based on DOMAIN_PLANNING, DATA_EXCHANGE
   and COMPENSATION_NEGOTIATION. these BELONG_TO two categories, namely,
   MULTISTAGE_LOCAL_PLANNING_DOMAIN based COORDINATION_MECHANISM (lpdcm) and
   SINGLE_STAGE global PLANNING domain based COORDINATION_MECHANISM (gpdcm).
   here dmas wants to maintain the PRIVACY of their STRATEGIC_INFORMATION. this
   asymmetry of information may cause increase in COST and generate
   INEFFICIENT_SOLUTIONS. the MECHANISMS preserve the PRIVACY of information
   using secure multi_party computation concepts.  this improves the quality of
   a plan and subsequent decision_making PROCESS of the COOPERATIVE_GAME
   significantly.  this WORK_INTRODUCES a secure multi_party LINEAR_PROGRAMMING
   extended PROTOCOL (smlpep) by extending an existing two_party secure
   LINEAR_PROGRAMMING PROTOCOL. this work extends the chakraborty'S work on
   COLLABORATIVE_PLANNING for SUPPLY_CHAIN [17] and [3], which in turn was
   based on dudek'S piece [6] of 2004. the PRESENT_WORK looks at the
   COLLABORATIVE_PLANNING_PROBLEM of [6] from the perspective of
   COOPERATIVE_GAME, focuses on the DEVELOPMENT of MECHANISM_DESIGN for
   EFFICIENT_COST SHARING purposes for several scenarios and thus enhances the
   GENERALIZATION_CAPABILITY of the problem.

AB ELECTRONIC_COLLABORATION (e_collaboration) is basically defined as
   COLLABORATION using ELECTRONIC_TECHNOLOGIES among DIFFERENT_INDIVIDUALS to
   achieve a COMMON_TASK. this FUZZY_DEFINITION can nevertheless be extended to
   incorporate business_to_business coordinated activities based on
   ELECTRONIC_TECHNOLOGIES as for example managing a SUPPLY_CHAIN (SC) with a
   GLOBAL_SOFTWARE_PACKAGE. indeed, in modern SUPPLY_CHAINS series of actors
   are interoperating to successfully combine the materials and flows to build
   value added products or services and bring them to their CUSTOMERS. when
   disposing of a COMMON_INFORMATION_TOOL the SC can be managed on a
   GLOBAL_BASIS with a DIRECT_EFFECT on POSSIBLE_OPTIMIZATIONS. indeed, when no
   COLLABORATION_EXISTS, the actors ONLY_DISPOSE of
   LOCAL_OPERATIONAL_INFORMATION and take MYOPIC_DECISIONS. when disposing of
   GLOBAL_INFORMATION about the orders, RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS with expected
   quantities, schedules, etc.  required by other actors, better decisions can
   be taken to SCHEDULE coming activities so that a GLOBAL_OPTIMIZATION can
   more easily be reached.  this paper presents the analysis, DESIGN and
   IMPLEMENTATION_STAGES of the DEVELOPMENT of a multi_actor
   COLLABORATIVE_PLATFORM for SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. more precisely, the
   platform is modeled using service_orientation; built around a multi_agent
   ARCHITECTURE and targeted to OUTBOUND_LOGISTICS with consequently a
   STRONG_FOCUS on TRANSPORTATION. the platform'S MAIN_REQUIREMENTS are modeled
   as services allowing designing a flexible and ADAPTABLE_SOFTWARE_SYSTEM that
   can be easily adopted on DEMAND when CUSTOMER_REQUIREMENTS_EVOLVE or when
   NEW_TECHNOLOGICAL_ADVANCES must be adopted.  in that perspective, the use of
   COTS_COMPONENTS into the platform is notably encouraged.  multi_agent
   architectures are from PRIMARY_INTEREST in the perspective of developing a
   service_oriented SYSTEM since AGENT_CHARACTERISTICS as openness,
   FLEXIBILITY, ADAPTABILITY, LEARNING, etc are in accordance with the
   advantages service_based systems must offer.  the platform'S services are
   consequently designed around a multi_agent SYSTEM.  2011

AB a multi_agent PLANNING_PROBLEM consists of a set of activities that need to
   be planned by several AGENTS. here, PLAN_COORDINATION_METHODS play an
   IMPORTANT_ROLE, since the independently generated plans by DIFFERENT_AGENTS
   can LEAD to an INFEASIBLE_JOINT_SOLUTION. we study one
   PARTICULAR_PLAN_COORDINATION_APPROACH, called coordination_by_design, which
   allows each AGENT to make ITS OWN_PLAN completely independent of the others,
   while guaranteeing the feasibility of the combined plan of all the AGENTS as
   a JOINT_SOLUTION to the multi_agent PLANNING_PROBLEM. in this paper, we are
   interested in a class of multi_agent PLANNING problems that arise in
   supply_chain MANAGEMENT APPLICATIONS. although the COORDINATION_PROBLEM in
   general is 2p_complete, it turns out for this SPECIAL_CLASS, the COMPLEXITY
   of COORDINATION checking is polynomial and deciding a MINIMUM_CO_ORDINATION
   set is np_complete.  we develop a polynomial_time approximation ALGORITHM to

   in this paper.  in the proposed multi_agent SYSTEM, the ARCHITECTURE
   fulfilling different participant'S INDIVIDUAL_REQUIREMENTS is designed to
   create efficient and RESPONSIVE_LOGISTICS SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION methods.
   the proposed multi_agent SYSTEM can adaptively change over time when

AB with the increasing INTERDEPENDENCE among SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS, BANKRUPTCY
   of a SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBER may be caused by OPERATIONAL_DECISIONS of other
   members.  to investigate how BANKRUPTCY_OCCURS and propagates in
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS, we build a multi_agent SIMULATION_MODEL for a
   two_stage SUPPLY_CHAIN that consists of MULTIPLE_UPSTREAM_MANUFACTURERS and
   multiple downstream RETAILERS. based on the developed SIMULATION_MODEL, we
   STUDY_IMPACTS of VARIOUS_OPERATIONAL_PARAMETERS and decisions, such as
   HORIZONTAL_COMPETITION among RETAILERS, ORDER_ALLOCATION strategies of
   RETAILERS, WHOLESALE_PRICE of MANUFACTURERS, characteristics of
   MARKET_DEMAND and number of RETAILERS, on BANKRUPTCY_PROPAGATION. since many
   OPERATIONAL_DECISIONS of a firm are made under FINANCIAL_CONSTRAINTS, we
   also investigate the linkage between firm'S operational RISKS and
   FINANCIAL_DECISIONS (e.g., the MAXIMAL_RISK of CASH_FLOW that a member is
   willing to take, and the up_front payment proportion of RETAILERS in a
   two_period payment POLICY). EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS reveal that
   OPERATIONAL_INTERACTIONS between SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS and
   OPERATIONAL_DECISIONS made by SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS are IMPORTANT_CAUSES of
   BANKRUPTCY_PROPAGATION, but impacts of these OPERATIONAL_PARAMETERS and

AB in this paper a new INTELLIGENT multi_agent SYSTEM is proposed for finding
   the best ORDERING_POLICY. the best ORDERING_POLICY is the POLICY which
   minimizes the TOTAL_COST of the SUPPLY_CHAIN that is the sum of all
   echelons' COSTS over all periods.  the best ORDERING_POLICY is obtained by a
   new window_base GENETIC_ALGORITHM. one limitation of the previous presented
   ga_based ALGORITHMS is the constraint of the fixed ordering rule for each
   member through the time.  to resolve this problem a new concept _window_ is
   introduced that is a parameter of the MODEL. application of the WINDOW_BASIS
   enables the AGENTS to have different ordering POLICIES through the time.
   another limitation of the PREVIOUS_RESEARCH is the WEAK_MANAGEMENT of
   UNCERTAINTY. in this RESEARCH, SUPPLY_CHAIN'S MAIN_PARAMETERS such as
   DEMAND_VALUE, ordering amount, LEAD_TIME and COSTS are all modeled by
   FUZZY_NUMBERS. the results show that the proposed multi_agent SYSTEM has a
   lower COST in comparison with SIMILAR_RESEARCH in the literature.  2010

AB in SUPPLY_CHAINS of the PETROLEUM_INDUSTRY, maintaining a balance between
   PRODUCTION and consumption of PETROLEUM_DERIVATIVES is a CRUCIAL_ISSUE.
   basically, this kind of CHAIN has several elements like PRODUCER_BASES,
   CONSUMER_BASES, INTERMEDIARY_TERMINALS that are linked by a
   TRANSPORT_NETWORK. these elements should cooperate to reach the
   GLOBAL_BALANCE of the SYSTEM with a MINIMUM_TRANSPORTATION_COST. in this
   context, this paper proposes and compares two SOLUTIONS based on AUCTIONS
   carried out by AGENTS, which represent the elements of the
   AFOREMENTIONED_CHAIN. these SOLUTIONS are characterized respectively by the
   execution of SEQUENTIAL_AUCTIONS and SIMULTANEOUS_AUCTIONS in order to
   consumers bid for batches of CRUDE_OIL_DERIVATIVES. in the
   COMPARATIVE_TESTS, the solution based on SIMULTANEOUS_AUCTIONS is better
   than the sequential one mainly because of the INTENSE_COOPERATION among
   AGENTS. 2010 ieee.

   DYNAMICS_CHARACTERISTICS of the MANUFACTURER_DIVISION of labor, which is
   based on the swarm_based SUPPLY_CHAIN_OPERATION MODEL. while this MODEL

AB trends of globalization and advances in INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY (it) have
   created opportunity in COLLABORATIVE MANUFACTURING across national borders.
   a dynamic SUPPLY_CHAIN utilizes these advances to enable more FLEXIBILITY in
   BUSINESS_COOPERATION. this RESEARCH proposes a
   CONCURRENT_DECISION_MAKING_FRAMEWORK for a three echelons dynamic
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL. the dynamic SUPPLY_CHAIN is formed by
   AUTONOMOUS_NEGOTIATION among AGENTS based on MULTI_AGENTS_APPROACH. instead
   of generating NEGOTIATION_ASPECTS (such as amount, price and DUE_DATE)
   arbitrary, this framework proposes to utilize the information available at
   OPERATIONAL_LEVEL of an ORGANIZATION in order to generate
   REALISTIC_NEGOTIATION_ASPECT. the effectiveness of the proposed MODEL is

AB TRUST_MANAGEMENT is nowadays considered a PROMISING_ENABLER_TECHNOLOGY to
   extend the AUTOMATION of the SUPPLY_CHAIN to the search, EVALUATION and
   selection of SUPPLIERS located world_wide.  CURRENT agent_based
   COMPUTATIONAL_TRUST and REPUTATION (ctr) SYSTEMS_CONCERN the representation,
   dissemination and aggregation of TRUST_EVIDENCES for
   TRUSTWORTHINESS_ASSESSMENT, and some RECENT_PROPOSALS are moving towards
   situation_aware SOLUTIONS that allow the ESTIMATION of TRUST when the
   information about a given supplier is scarce or even null.  however, these
   enhanced, situation_aware proposals rely on ontology_like techniques that
   are not FINE_GRAINED enough to detect light, but relevant, tendencies on
   supplier'S behaviour.  in this paper, we propose a TECHNIQUE that allows the
   extraction of positive and NEGATIVE_TENDENCIES of SUPPLIERS in the
   fulfilment of established CONTRACTS. this TECHNIQUE can be used with any of
   the existing "traditional" CTR_SYSTEMS, improving their ability in
   selectively selecting a partner based on the characteristics of the
   situation in EVALUATION. in this paper, we test our proposal using an
   AGGREGATION_ENGINE that embeds IMPORTANT_PROPERTIES of the DYNAMICS of
   TRUST_BUILDING.

AB CONSTRUCTION_INDUSTRY is specifically full of COMPLEXITY and difficulty,
   specifically in large_scale PUBLIC_WORKS_PROJECT. CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY_CHAIN
   (csc) MANAGEMENT is investigated as an effective and EFFICIENT_MEASURE and
   STRATEGY to deal with the problems in CONSTRUCTION. but COOPERATION and
   DECISION_MAKING between partners are still key and DIFFICULT_PROBLEMS in
   CSC_MANAGEMENT. in this paper, we propose a simulating MODEL for
   CSC_MANAGEMENT based on multi_agent method under analysis of the
   SPECIAL_CHARACTERS in csc.  then, we analyze the MODEL_CLASSES in detail and

AB globalization has enhanced the need for EFFECTIVE_MANAGEMENT of SUPPLY_CHAIN
   in GLOBAL_CONTEXT. as the SUPPLY_CHAIN gets bigger, it becomes increasingly
   complex as the number of variables to handle increase along with the
   difficulty to coordinate between LARGE_NUMBER of members.
   PETROLEUM_INDUSTRY SUPPLY_CHAIN is one SUCH_COMPLEX SUPPLY_CHAIN because of
   the LARGE_NUMBER of processes involved right from
   EXTRACTION_TILL_CUSTOMER_DELIVERY. LARGE_NUMBER of COMPANIES are involved in
   such a CHAIN, and ITS success or failure is detrimental to the ECONOMY of
   the nation.  multi_agent TECHNOLOGY provides an OPTIMAL_PLATFORM for
   effective and efficient SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT of large SUPPLY_CHAINS as it
   breaks the SUPPLY_CHAIN into DISCRETE_AGENTS thus rendering easier
   COORDINATION between the AGENTS. in this paper multi_agent TECHNOLOGY has
   been applied to make the SUPPLY_CHAIN faster as compared to conventional
   SUPPLY_CHAIN practices.  the number of alternatives available in a petroleum
   SUPPLY_CHAIN is more and this also increases the number of AGENTS. here a
   representative but EXHAUSTIVE_MODEL is considered, by taking into account
   the VARIOUS_OPTIONS available at each AGENT. it has also been made
   additionally complex by including REALISTIC_ASSUMPTIONS like non_linear
   quantity dependence of COST of OPERATION. solving this problem requires an
   advanced HEURISTIC_METHOD like co_evolutionary PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION
   based on CAUCHY_DISTRIBUTION which has been precisely made for COST and
   RESOURCE_ALLOCATION. cauchy provides a very RAPID_PATH towards approaching
   the solution.  the PREVIOUS_WORK done on the co_pso using GAUSSIAN_APPROACH
   is compared with that of CAUCHY_APPROACH and RELEVANT_CONCLUSIONS are drawn.
   SIMULATION_RESULTS also indicate the better CONVERGENCE_CHARACTERISTICS of
   the cauchy over GAUSSIAN_APPROACH, hence proving ITS nobility.
   COMPARATIVE_STUDY of the FINAL_RESULTS of the two methodologies also
   indicates towards the superiority of the CAUCHY_APPROACH.  2010

AB in RECENT_DAYS, the INDUSTRIAL_SECTOR is characterised by saturated

   COMPANIES try to optimise their SUPPLY_CHAINS in order to improve their

AB very few industries can BENEFIT more from maximizing SUPPLY_CHAIN
   efficiencies than the oil and GAS_COMPANIES [1]. however, the behavior of
   SUCH_SYSTEMS is too complex to be treated analytically.  on the other hand,
   multi_agent systems show GREAT_SIMILARITY with respect to SUPPLY_CHAINS, and
   provide the FLEXIBILITY to MODEL the complexities and DYNAMICS of
   REAL_WORLD_CHAINS without excessive SIMPLIFYING_ASSUMPTIONS. since
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT deals with a RECURSIVE_STRUCTURE, it becomes
   appropriate to EMPLOY_HOLONIC_AGENTS for ITS MODELING. thus, this WORK_AIMS
   at developing a holonic multi_agent MODEL for a TYPICAL_OIL_INDUSTRY
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. a SIMPLE_CASE_STUDY is analyzed as a proof_of_concept of the

AB one of the CRITICAL_FACTORS for a SUCCESSFUL_COOPERATIVE_RELATIONSHIP in a

   and do not have a STRONG_THEORETICAL_BASIS. as a result, they are unable to

   change of MANUFACTURE_PROCESSES and BUSINESS_PROCESSES, on condition that
   there is a transformation of ORGANIZATIONAL_STRUCTURE, TECHNOLOGICAL_PROCESS

   FUNCTION_LAYER). firstly, BUSINESS_FUNCTION is separated from description of
   factory by the MODEL_LAYER; then, BUSINESS_LOGIC keeps apart from
   TECHNICAL_SUPPORT via the PLATFORM_LAYER and the
   OVERALL_PROCESS_COLLABORATION and GLOBAL_OPTIMIZATION can be put into
   practice by means of the same layer; ultimately, standardized
   FUNCTION_INTERFACE is designed for DIFFERENT_PRODUCTS through the

AB the PRIMARY_GOAL of an agile SUPPLY_CHAIN is to meet the varying DEMAND of

   the PRESENT_CHAPTER proposes a RECONFIGURABLE multi_agent
   ARCHITECTURE_FRAMEWORK that can assist in selecting OUTSOURCING partners and
   develop EFFECTIVE_COORDINATION among the partners and between MANUFACTURING
   units.  the proposed multi_agent ARCHITECTURE is inspired by the HUMAN
   self_healing mechanism and is capable of managing DISRUPTIONS that occur
   during MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. when a NEW_PRODUCTION_ORDER is introduced,

AB a NOVEL_FORMAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION_APPROACH for real_time
   multi_agent SYSTEM is presented in this paper.  the METHODOLOGY of our
   approach consists in translating extended AUML_DIAGRAMS describing rt_mas'
   FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS into a rt_maude specification.  the proposed
   APPROACH_CONSIDERS jointly functional, static and DYNAMIC_ASPECTS of
   real_time multi_agent systems.  the FUNCTIONAL_ASPECTS are described by a
   TEMPORAL_AUML_USE_CASE_DIAGRAM and the STATIC_ASPECTS are represented using
   a TEMPORAL_AUML_CLASS_DIAGRAM. whereas the DYNAMIC_ASPECTS are described
   using STATE_CHART (INDIVIDUAL_BEHAVIOR) and an extended AUML_PROTOCOL
   (COLLECTIVE_BEHAVIOR) diagrams.  the aims of this approach are, on the one
   hand, to combine the advantages of the graphical MODELING
   FORMALISM_AGENT_UML and the FORMAL_SPECIFICATION language rt_maude in a
   single TECHNIQUE, and, on the other hand, to integrating the
   FORMAL_VALIDATION of the CONSISTENCY of the MODELS, since the

AB INFORMATION_SYSTEMS are crucial for effective SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT in
   today'S complex SUPPLY_CHAINS for DURABLE_GOODS.
   COMPLEX_DECISION_MAKING_PROCESSES on strategic, tactical, and
   OPERATIONAL_LEVEL require SUBSTANTIAL_SUPPORT in order to contribute to the
   AGILITY of organizations.  SUPPLY_CHAIN regimes, I.e., regimes encompassing
   both the SALES and the PROCUREMENT_MARKET in a complex SUPPLY_CHAIN, provide
   a way of intuitively and meaningfully characterizing and MODELING
   SUPPLY_CHAIN MARKET_CONDITIONS without a need for explicit MODELING of
   INDIVIDUAL_ASPECTS of the MARKET. t his paper makes a first EXPLORATIVE_STEP
   towards a MODEL incorporating SUCH_REGIMES, while maintaining the DYNAMICS
   which enable the MODEL to be utilized in the SALES_PROCESS, e.g., for
   DYNAMIC_PRODUCT PRICING. INITIAL_RESULTS show that SUPPLY_CHAIN regimes have
   FEASIBLE_CHARACTERISTICS, based on both SALES and
   PROCUREMENT_MARKET_INDICATORS. taking into consideration these regimes
   enables a more DELIBERATE_SALES_MODEL. 2010 ieee.

AB PURPOSETHE_PURPOSE of this paper is to focus on a SUPPLY_CHAIN (SC)
   SIMULATION of all ITS MANAGEMENT_PROCESSES by means of a multi_agent SYSTEM
   (MAS). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/approachnowadays, the company must develop ITS
   activity in an ENVIRONMENT characterized by&colon; globalization,
   HARD_COMPETITIVENESS, the necessity of FLEXIBILITY and of answering
   dynamically to a changing DEMAND. thus, a distributed, AUTONOMOUS_APPROACH,
   strong enough to face changes is necessary, which is what MASS_CONTRIBUTE
   to.  an AGENT can represent each of the COMPONENTS that form the SC. then
   the resulting AGENT_SYSTEM will OWN_SIMILAR_CHARACTERISTICS to the ones in
   the studied SC&colon; AUTONOMY, SOCIAL_ABILITIES, REACTIVITY, pro_activity.
   findingswhen analysing the DEMAND for each SC_MEMBER (from manufacturer to
   FINAL_CONSUMER), one can observe that while CONSUMER_DEMAND is a relatively
   stable feature, the UPPER_LINK in the CHAIN (the manufacturer), presents a
   very pronounced variability.  this is known as the "BULLWHIP_EFFECT" or
   "FORRESTER_EFFECT" and is mainly due to the fact that the SC_MEMBERS'
   strategies are not considered as a whole but as a sum of
   INDIVIDUAL_STRATEGIES. in the proposed SYSTEM, each AGENT will be
   communicated with other "AGENTS" who will be the only responsible for making
   FORECASTS based on information provided to it by all COMPONENTS of the
   CHAIN. the ULTIMATE_GOAL is for each SC_ECHELON to satisfy ITS
   OWN_OBJECTIVES, while at the same TIME_MEET the local and
   EXTERNAL_CONSTRAINTS. RESEARCH limitations/implicationsin this work a
   STANDARD_SC is proposed (one manufacturer  one distributor  one wholesaler
   one RETAILER) although it could easily be modified to incorporate a bigger
   number of members in each echelon within the SC. originality/valuethe

AB according to TRANSACTION_COST_ECONOMICS, CONTRACTS are always incomplete and
   offer opportunities to defect.  some level of TRUST is a SINE_QUA_NON for
   trade.  if the seller is better informed about PRODUCT_QUALITY than the
   buyer, the buyer has to rely on information the seller provides or has to
   check the information by testing the product or tracing the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROCESSES, thus incurring EXTRA_TRANSACTION_COST. an
   OPPORTUNISTIC_SELLER who assumes the buyer to TRUST, may deliver a lower
   QUALITY_PRODUCT than agreed upon.  in HUMAN_DECISIONS to deceive and to show
   TRUST or distrust, issues like MUTUAL_EXPECTATIONS, shame, self_esteem,
   personality, and REPUTATION are involved.  these factors depend in part on

AB researchers, practitioners and ENTERPRISE_SOFTWARE_PROVIDERS are realising
   the potential of agent_based TECHNOLOGY to automate SUPPLY_CHAIN PROCUREMENT
   to achieve consistent, TRACEABLE_DECISION_MAKING. as the COMPLEXITY of
   SUPPLY_CHAINS grow, these systems will gain more attention.  in this paper,
   we MODEL and simulate a COMPLEX_AUTONOMOUS SUPPLY_CHAIN managed by
   COMPUTATIONAL_AGENTS that aim to MINIMISE_LEAD_TIME and MAXIMISE_REVENUE
   through evolutionary multi_objective OPTIMISATION. the AGENTS are in a
   COMPETITIVE_ENVIRONMENT where they take on the roles of both client and
   producer.  in addition to optimising their PRODUCTION_STRATEGY, they also
   have the opportunity to dynamically fine_tune their DECISION_PARAMETERS when
   it comes to selecting their OWN_SUPPLIERS, using the
   ANALYTICAL_HIERARCHY_PROCESS. it is observed that COMPUTATIONAL_AGENTS are
   capable of functioning in SUCH_COMPLEX_ENVIRONMENTS, effectively converging
   to POLICIES in synergy with their MARKET. multi_objective, multi_role
   OPTIMISATION results in better overall SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE than tests
   where AGENTS have single_objectives and single_roles.  our STUDY_FORMS an

AB ENTERPRISES continuously seek DECISION_SUPPORT_TOOLS that can help automate
   and CODIFY_BUSINESS_DECISIONS. this is particularly true in the business of
   CONSUMER_ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURING where COMPONENTS are often
   interchangeable and several MANUFACTURERS can SUPPLY the same COMPONENT over
   the life of a product.  in this kind of DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT, businesses are
   faced with the choice of signing long_term (possibly quite risky) CONTRACTS
   or of waiting to procure NECESSARY_COMPONENTS on the SPOT_MARKET (where
   availability may be uncertain). having ANALYTICAL_TOOLS to analyze previous
   and FORECAST FUTURE_MARKET_CONDITIONS is invaluable.  we analyze a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_SCENARIO from an ECONOMIC_PERSPECTIVE that involves both
   COMPONENT_PROCUREMENT and SALES_UNCERTAINTIES. the data we analyze comes
   from a multi_agent SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT SIMULATION_ENVIRONMENT (TAC_SCM)
   which simulates a one_year product life_cycle.  the availability of
   SIMULATION_LOGS allows us access to a RICH_SET of data which includes the

AB GRAI_METHODOLOGY is one of the three MAIN_METHODOLOGIES for
   ENTERPRISE_MODELING (with pera and cimosa). to support this METHODOLOGY
   DIFFERENT_TOOLS are being developed.  graixpert is a HYBRID_EXPERT_SYSTEM
   for detecting inconsistencies in ENTERPRISES. graisuc is a module for
   choosing and implementing SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT tool in ENTERPRISES.
   graiqual is a module for improving QUALITY_SYSTEM of ENTERPRISES. these
   modules are based on the use of DIFFERENT_REASONING (case_based reasoning
   (CBR), DECOMPOSITION, transforma_tion) but also on the
   ENTERPRISE_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT. the ENTERPRISE_KNOWLEDGE could be explicit
   or tacit.  each case of ENTERPRISE studied allows to improve the KNOWLEDGE
   of the tool.  then, multi_agent systems are used for acquiring this
   KNOWLEDGE and managing improvement.  this paper presents how multi_agent
   SYSTEM could be associated to CBR and DECOMPOSITION_REASONING in order to be
   more efficient during the ENTERPRISE_MODELLING.  springer_verlag berlin

AB distributed TASK_ASSIGNMENT is a CONVENIENT_ABSTRACTION for load_balancing
   APPLICATIONS, WORKFLOW_SYSTEMS or supply_chain MANAGEMENT. the
   TOPOLOGICAL_FEATURES of SUCH_TASK_NETWORKS are far from random but instead
   resemble that of small_worlds and scale_free NETWORKS. the AGENT'S
   INTERACTION is accordingly prescribed by this NETWORK_STRUCTURE. simulating
   DECENTRALISED OPTIMISATION_ALGORITHMS using the MATHEMATICAL_FRAMEWORK of
   QUEUEING_THEORY, it has been shown that KNOWLEDGE of a neighbour'S queueing
   STATE_FACILITATES the minimisation of the accrued delay in a network.
   therefore BENIGN_AGENTS that have the same neighbour can share their
   experience and collaborate in training the FUNCTION_APPROXIMATOR according
   to the sarsa(0) gradient_descent update rule.  the
   FUNCTION_APPROXIMATOR_RESIDES on the TARGET_NODE and ITS learnt state_action
   value mapping is shared among all nodes connecting to it.  this setting is
   evaluated empirically using sarsa(0) REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING with the
   standard e_greedy POLICY and the weighted POLICY_LEARNER. we show that under
   CERTAIN_CONDITIONS this leads to improved SYSTEM_PERFORMANCE compared to
   individually trained FUNCTION_APPROXIMATORS.  2010 ieee.

AB this paper presents an agent_based FUZZY constraint_directed
   NEGOTIATION_MECHANISM for PLANNING_AND_SCHEDULING in SUPPLY_CHAIN. the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_SCHEDULING_PROBLEM is modeled as a set of
   FUZZY_CONSTRAINT_SATISFACTION_PROBLEMS (fcsps), interlinked together by
   inter_agent constraints.  for converging each distinct firm'S interests, the
   CONFLICTS among the set of fcsps are resolved through NEGOTIATION by
   iteratively exchanging offers/counters with limited SHARING of their
   perspectives and preferences.  during the NEGOTIATION, proposing
   offers/counter_offers takes not only firm'S self_interest and preferences
   but also opponents' perspectives into consideration.  by SHARING
   perspectives between AGENTS to gradually uncovering the intent of opponents,
   CONSENSUS can be obtained and the quality of CONSENSUS can be guaranteed at
   SATISFACTORY_LEVEL. EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS suggest that the proposed
   APPROACH_OBTAINS a SUPERIOR_SOLUTION for SUPPLY_CHAIN SCHEDULING than other

AB a SUPPLY_CHAIN (SC) is a world_wide COMPLEX_NETWORK of SUPPLIERS, factories,
   WAREHOUSES, DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS and RETAILERS. due to the features of ITS
   PRODUCTION_PLANNING: DISTRIBUTION, AUTONOMY, synchronism and openness, the
   TRADITIONAL_METHODS of PRODUCTION_PLANNING are unable to meet the demands of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN PRODUCTION_PLANNING (scpp). under COLLABORATIVE_ENVIRONMENT, in
   order to eliminate CONFLICTS generated among DIFFERENT_ENTERPRISES PLANNING,
   SCPP_NEEDS to integrate and use all the RESOURCES in the SUPPLY_CHAIN from
   the WHOLE_LAYOUT_VIEW. based on the analysis of multi_agent TECHNOLOGY and
   the characteristics of scpp, an multi_agent based MODEL of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK is proposed, in which the functional and
   PHYSICAL_ENTITIES of the SYSTEM are encapsulated by VARIOUS_KINDS of AGENTS.
   then the multi_agent based PRODUCTION_PLANNING_MODEL is established and
   discussed.  as a whole, the MODEL can be divided into three LAYERS: the
   OVERALL_PRODUCTION panning, sub_production PLANNING in ENTERPRISE and
   detailed PRODUCTION_PLANNING of tasks.  it breaks through the limitations of
   TRADITIONAL_METHODS, excellently reflects the information_sharing and
   resource_sharing principles of SUPPLY_CHAIN and can effectively support the

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM) has received increased attention in a globally
   CHALLENGING_ENVIRONMENT as COMPANIES face the necessity to improve
   CUSTOMER_SERVICE and MAXIMIZE_PROFIT. therefore,
   DYNAMIC_RECONFIGURATION_CAPABILITY is vital for SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT to
   respond to changing CUSTOMER_REQUIREMENTS and OPERATING_ENVIRONMENTS. on the
   other hand, for ITS flexible and AUTONOMOUS_CHARACTERISTICS, multi_agent
   systems are a VIABLE_TECHNOLOGY for SCM, and have been widely applied in
   SCM. to this end, DYNAMIC_RECONFIGURATION in agent_based SCM_SYSTEMS is
   proposed from AUTONOMY oriented computing point of view.  the PERFORMANCE of
   agent_based SCM with DYNAMIC_RECONFIGURATION is evaluated under a modified
   TAC_SCM_SCENARIO. with a DYNAMIC_RECONFIGURABLE_SCM_SYSTEM, NEW_PRODUCTS and

AB multi_agent SYSTEM technologies are currently becoming a strong MODELLING
   tool for supporting the complexities present in PLANNING SUPPLY_CHAINS. as
   SUPPLY_CHAINS are composed by nodes needing COMMON_AGREEMENT to fulfil their
   OWN_REQUIREMENTS, the multi_agent SYSTEM thus represents a SUITABLE_TOOL for
   MODELLING NEGOTIATION, mainly within a COLLABORATIVE_CONTEXT. nevertheless,
   a REVIEW of the RELEVANT_LITERATURE revealed a CERTAIN_DEFICIENCY in
   existing agent_based MODELLING methodologies supporting COLLABORATIVE
   SUPPLY_CHAIN PLANNING. this paper has thus proposed a novel agent_based
   MODELLING METHODOLOGY to cover SUCH_DEFICIENCY to make a REAL_CONTRIBUTION
   towards SUPPLY_CHAIN agent_based MODELLING within a
   COLLABORATIVE_PLANNING_ENVIRONMENT. this METHODOLOGY was supported by the
   RELEVANT_ASPECTS found in the LITERATURE_REVIEW regarding
   COLLABORATIVE_PLANNING within a multi_agent context (AGENT_DEFINITION,
   scope, DECISIONAL_LEVEL, DISTRIBUTION and SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK entities,
   MODELLING TECHNIQUE, INTERACTION, COORDINATION_MECHANISM, advantages and
   disadvantages) and EXPLICIT_METHODOLOGIES supporting the agent_based
   MODELLING of any type of problem under consideration.  by considering the
   CORRESPONDING_LITERATURE_REVIEW, the proposed NEW_METHODOLOGY synthesised
   existing KNOWLEDGE in the field and both fulfilled and enriched each of ITS
   phases with our OWN_MODELLERS' KNOWLEDGE. this study adopted a STATIC_VIEW
   of a REAL_AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK so as to present a first real
   multi_agent_based SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL approach as an application of this
   novel MODELLING METHODOLOGY.

AB the purpose of this paper is to propose and test a multi_agent_based SYSTEM
   for automated multi_attribute NEGOTIATION in ORDER_PROMISING. in a
   make_to_order PRODUCTION_MODEL, it is not always possible to satisfy the
   available_to_promise (atp) and capable_to_promise (ctp) conditions.
   therefore, it is important to quickly EXPLORE_ALTERNATE_SOLUTIONS that would
   satisfy both the customer and the supplier.  we adopt the concepts of
   EVOLUTIONARY_SYSTEM_DESIGN that advocates for CONTINUOUS_EXPLORATION of
   NEW_SOLUTIONS based on EXTENSIVE_SEARCH and multi_attribute SIMULATIONS that
   help identify for better negotiated SOLUTIONS based on real_life ordering
   situations _ changes of DELIVERY_DATE, PRICE_ADJUSTMENTS,
   addition/modifications of valueadded services as part of the order.  results
   of our SIMULATIONS showed that NEGOTIATION_PROCEDURES did reduce the number

AB the application of multi_agent systems in the context of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT has been much discussed during the last years and
   several implementations have emerged within RESEARCH. yet very few
   APPLICATIONS are actually being used in practice.  the reason for this lies
   in an existing gap between DOMAIN_CONCEPTS and AGENT_TECHNOLOGY, which
   complicates the APPLICATION_ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. a framework can support
   this PROCESS in order to devise customized and FLEXIBLE_SOLUTIONS by
   providing the NECESSARY_AGENT_MODULES and a SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT

   perspective, supports the INFORMATION_SHARING processes that any of ITS node
   will be able to carry out to support ITS PROCESS in a COLLABORATIVE_MANNER,

AB this PAPER_ADDRESSES the impact of RFID_TECHNOLOGY on SUPPLY_CHAIN by
   increasing ITS VISIBILITY of in_transit products.  in the proposed SYSTEM,
   ACTIVE_RFID_TAGS are attached to PERISHABLE_PRODUCTS in the TRANSPORTATION,
   so that real_time information of in_transit products is achievable, and
   shared in the WHOLE_CHAIN_SYSTEM. then, HIERARCHICAL_DECISION is made
   according to this real_time information.  in the lower level, OPTIMAL_ROUTE
   is chosen to minimize the TOTAL_COST of delivering.  in the UPPER_LEVEL,
   OPTIMAL_ORDER is calculated to satisfy CUSTOMER_DEMAND and minimize the
   variance of the orders.  by multi_agent approach, we simulate a
   three_echelon SUPPLY_CHAIN, in which each SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBER is represented
   and acted as an AUTONOMOUS_AGENT. our results prove that SHARING of RFID
   generated information can significantly improve SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM
   PERFORMANCE and reduce BULLWHIP_EFFECT of the SUPPLY_CHAIN. moreover, it
   indicates that this real_time information will be much valuable if it is
   further integrated into operational SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. 2009 ieee.

AB in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT and ASSET_TRACKING, identifying an item and ITS'
   LOCATION is very important.  RFID_TECHNOLOGY is suitable to perform the
   IDENTIFICATION and tracking for better ASSET_MANAGEMENT. RFID_TAGS can be
   embedded and attached to the items and their information can be classified
   for VERIFICATION_PROCESS. this is important to avoid problems such as data
   lost during DATA_MANAGEMENT as well as for TIME_MANAGEMENT. multi_agent
   TECHNOLOGY is useful to be implemented during the verification of
   RFID_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE because INTELLIGENT_AGENT has the capability to
   define SPECIFIC_VERIFICATION_PROCESS and can interact to each other in order
   to improve the EFFICIENCY of the RFID_SYSTEM. multi_agent SYSTEM, in this
   verification of RFID_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE has a role in formulating the
   SYSTEM_TAXONOMY. therefore, in this paper, the VERIFICATION_PROCESS of
   RFID_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE has been discussed and successfully implemented in
   RFID shopping SYSTEM. the implementation has been tested and evaluated.  the

AB TRUST is a SINE_QUA_NON for trade.  according to TRANSACTION_COST_ECONOMICS,
   a contract always offers some opportunity to defect.  in the case of
   ASYMMETRIC_PRODUCT_INFORMATION, where the seller is better informed about
   PRODUCT_QUALITY than the buyer is, the buyer either has to rely on
   information provided by the seller or has to check the information by
   testing the product or tracing the SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROCESSES, thus incurring
   EXTRA_TRANSACTION_COST. an OPPORTUNISTIC_SELLER who assumes the buyer to
   TRUST, may deliver a lower QUALITY_PRODUCT than agreed upon.  in
   HUMAN_DECISIONS to deceive and to show TRUST or distrust toward
   BUSINESS_PARTNERS, issues like morality, shame, self_esteem, and REPUTATION
   are involved.  these factors depend strongly on trader'S
   CULTURAL_BACKGROUND. this paper develops an AGENT_MODEL of DECEIT and TRUST
   and describes a multi_agent SIMULATION where TRADING_AGENTS are
   differentiated according to hofstede'S dimensions of NATIONAL_CULTURE.  2009

AB participating members in a MANUFACTURING SUPPLY_CHAIN (msc) usually make use
   of INDIVIDUAL_KNOWLEDGE for making INDEPENDENT_DECISIONS. RECENT_RESEARCH,
   however, indicates that there is a need to handle such distributed KNOWLEDGE
   in an integrated manner, especially under uncertain and fast changing
   environments.  a MULTIAGENT_SYSTEM (MAS), a branch of distributed
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE, is a contemporary MODELLING TECHNIQUE for a
   DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM like mscs in the MANUFACTURING domain.  however
   RECENT_RESEARCHES indicate that MAS_APPROACHES have not adequately addressed
   the role of SHARING TACIT_KNOWLEDGE (tk) on MSC_PERFORMANCE. this paper,
   therefore, aims to propose a framework that UTILIZES_MAS_TECHNIQUES with a
   CORRESPONDING_TK SHARING mechanism dedicated to mscs.  we performed some
   EXPERIMENTS to simulate the proposed approach.  the results showed
   SIGNIFICANT_IMPROVEMENTS when comparing the proposed approach with another
   CONVENTIONAL_MAS_MODEL. the results establish a starting point for

AB nowadays, products are expected to have features such as more innovative,
   MULTI_FUNCTIONAL, HIGH_QUALITY, and LOW_PRICE because of the changing of
   consumers' PURCHASING behavior.  this PHENOMENON_FORCES
   MANUFACTURING_INDUSTRIES to lower their COST, SHORTEN_INNOVATION_TIME, and
   collaborate with COMPANIES in their SUPPLY_CHAIN. however, it is difficult
   to collaborate among SUPPLY_CHAIN_COMPANIES because of the WIDE_DISTRIBUTION
   and limitations of COMPANIES. due to the characteristics of AGENTS, such as
   AUTONOMOUS_ABILITY, SOCIAL_ABILITY (communicative), applying multi_agent
   SYSTEM (MAS) to SUPPLY_CHAIN_COLLABORATION has been demonstrated with
   fascinating results.  furthermore, SUPPLY_CHAIN_COLLABORATION problem can be
   regarded as a distributed CONSTRAINTS_SATISFACTION_PROBLEM (DCSP) since
   constraints are diverted in SUPPLY_CHAIN echelons.  therefore, incorporating
   DCSP_TECHNIQUES into MAS will form the basis for achieving better DECISION
   among SUPPLY_CHAIN_COLLABORATION. however, related RESEARCH is lack and to
   be wanting.  hence, this paper develops a DCSP_ALGORITHM that can be
   appropriately applied for MANUFACTURING (oem) SUPPLY_CHAIN_COLLABORATION.
   our RESEARCH finds that using a SUITABLE_DCSP_ALGORITHM, time and COST can
   be reduced in MANUFACTURING SUPPLY_CHAIN and better effectiveness can be

AB within a SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK, it is common for COMPANIES to engage in
   negotiations to resolve CONFLICTS in TASK_ALLOCATION and
   ORDER_FULFILMENT_PROBLEMS. this kind of SUPPLY_CHAIN NEGOTIATION is usually
   regarded as buyer_seller NEGOTIATION. in RECENT_YEARS, multi_agent systems
   have been established to automate buyer_seller negotiations.  however, most
   have limitations in handling COMPLEX_NEGOTIATION_SCENARIOS such as
   MULTILATERAL_NEGOTIATIONS and multi_issue negotiations.  this paper presents
   ecnpro (the extended contract_net_like multilateral PROTOCOL), which is a
   new multi_agent PROTOCOL for handling buyer_seller negotiations in
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. ecnpro is designed to handle AGENT_BARGAINING and
   INTERACTIONS in COMPLEX_MULTILATERAL and multi_issue negotiations in which
   the buyer has to negotiate with many SUPPLIERS. the multi_attribute
   UTILITY_THEORY (maut) approach is adopted to establish the UTILITY_FUNCTIONS
   for a set of NEGOTIATION_ISSUES in the BARGAINING_PROCESS. it adopts a
   multi_threaded approach to allow the buyer to bargain concurrently with
   MULTIPLE_SUPPLIERS. ecnpro is able to split an order to more than one
   supplier to achieve a better NEGOTIATION_PAYOFF. in addition, MOBILE_AGENTS
   are employed in ecnpro, the BUYER_SENDS MOBILE_AGENTS to sites of the
   sellers to CONDUCT_BARGAINING locally.  this APPROACH_IMPROVES the
   NEGOTIATION_EFFICIENCY significantly.

   such as over_supply or scarcity, from HISTORICAL_DATA using

AB this paper presents a METHODOLOGY for evaluating CITY_LOGISTICS_MEASURES
   considering the behaviour of several STAKEHOLDERS associated with
   URBAN_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT using a multi_agent MODEL. the MODEL constructed
   consists of a LEARNING_MODEL and a MODEL for VEHICLE_ROUTING and
   SCHEDULING_PROBLEM with time window_forecasted (vrp_tw_f). we used a method
   of q_learning, a TECHNIQUE of REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING, in constructing a
   LEARNING_MODEL. we implemented the MODEL on a TEST_ROAD_NETWORK representing
   an URBAN_AREA. the results indicate that implementing a TRUCK_BAN directly
   to environmentally damaged areas and discounting MOTORWAY_TOLLS entirely in
   the URBAN_MOTORWAY_NETWORK together has LARGE_ENVIRONMENTAL effects, and
   leads to an ACCEPTABLE_ENVIRONMENT for all STAKEHOLDERS.  2010 ELSEVIER_LTD.

AB COLLABORATIVE e_procurement has been considered as a VITAL_LINK in many
   world_class SUPPLY_CHAIN strategies.  most of the previous related studies
   just covered the PURCHASING of DISTINCT_ITEMS. however, each buyer may have
   the PURCHASE_NEEDS for MULTIPLE_HETEROGENEOUS_ITEMS at the same time.
   therefore, in this RESEARCH, we address a multi_agent based
   COMBINATORIAL_AUCTION_MODEL for COLLABORATIVE e_procurement as a
   NEW_BUSINESS_MODEL that combines the strength of the COMBINATIONAL_AUCTION
   and the benefits of COLLABORATIVE e_procurement.  a
   REPRESENTATIVE_COMBINATORIAL_AUCTION based COLLABORATIVE e_procurement
   (cacp) PROCESS is presented, then, the SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE and optimized
   BID_SELECTION MODELING for cacp are described.  finally we show the
   VIABILITY of cacp through proof_of_concept prototype EXPERIMENT_RESULTS.

   this RESEARCH is to contribute to the understanding of how
   AGENT_BASED_MODELING (abm) can advance DECISION_MAKING and to discuss why
   abm should be regarded as method to realize INFORMATION_FUSION (if). in this

AB COOPERATIVE_ALLIANCES in SUPPLY_CHAINS have been attracting increasing
   interests from SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT researchers.  while LEARNING from
   experience seems to positively affect the ALLIANCE_PERFORMANCE in
   SUPPLY_CHAIN, there is a lack of an EXPLICIT_DESCRIPTION on
   LEARNING_MECHANISM for ALLIANCE_MEMBERS. therefore, this paper proposes a
   two_dimensional LEARNING_MECHANISM for ALLIANCE_MEMBERS in multi_agent
   SUPPLY_CHAINS. INTELLIGENT_AGENTS with LEARNING abilities are modeled as
   MEMBER_FIRMS, in which the LEARNING_STRUCTURES based on
   REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING are defined.  the validity of SUCH_FRAMEWORK is
   established by simulating an EXAMPLE_LEARNING_APPLICATION using the
   simplified proposed LEARNING_MECHANISM in a SUPPLY_CHAIN_ALLIANCE.  2008

AB optimizing is a FUNDAMENTAL_CONCEPT in our MODERN_MATURE_ECONOMY.
   SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT also follows this trend and, as a consequence,
   NEW_TECHNIQUES are appearing over the years.  among those we find services
   oriented computing and COMPONENT based DEVELOPMENT. the first gives the
   ADEQUATE_STRUCTURE and FLEXIBILITY required in the DEVELOPMENT of
   LARGE_INDUSTRIAL_SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENTS, the second allows RECYCLING of
   generically developed code.  this paper is at the borders of these paradigms
   and constitutes an attempt to integrate COMPONENTS into service_oriented
   MODELLING. indeed, when developing huge multi_actor application packages,
   SOLUTIONS to SPECIFIC_PROBLEMS should be custom developed while others can
   be found in third party offers.  famos_c, the framework proposed in this
   paper, allows MODELLING SUCH_PROBLEMS and directly integrates a
   SELECTION_PROCESS among DIFFERENT_COMPONENTS based on their PERFORMANCE in
   functional and non_functional aspects.  the framework is firstly depicted
   and then evaluated on a CASE_STUDY in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT.  2009

AB COORDINATION_PLAYS a PIVOTAL_ROLE in SUCCESSFUL_DESIGN and implementation of
   SUPPLY_CHAINS, especially for those that are formed by independent and
   AUTONOMOUS_COMPANIES. more specifically, INFORMATION_SHARING has widely been
   regarded as an ESSENTIAL_TOOL to coordinate SUPPLY_CHAINS activities in
   order to overcome SUPPLY_CHAINS DYNAMICS. a MAJOR_CONTRIBUTION of this paper
   is to analyse the effects of negotiation_based INFORMATION_SHARING in a
   distributed make_to_order MANUFACTURING SUPPLY_CHAIN in a multi_period,
   multi_product types ENVIRONMENT, which is modelled as a multi_agent SYSTEM.
   information can only be exchanged through NEGOTIATION in the agent_based
   framework with DELIVERY_QUANTITY and DUE_DATE_FLEXIBILITY, which is
   significantly different from the past reported literature that shared
   information is available anytime.  four schemes, namely, STOCHASTIC_MODEL
   (sto), FLEXIBILITY in DELIVERY_QUANTITY and DUE_DATE without
   INFORMATION_SHARING (flex_ni), FLEXIBILITY in DELIVERY_QUANTITY and DUE_DATE
   with PARTIAL_INFORMATION SHARING (flex_pi), and FLEXIBILITY in
   DELIVERY_QUANTITY and DUE_DATE with FULL_INFORMATION SHARING (flex_fi), are
   considered.  SIMULATION_RESULTS indicate that flex_pi in the SYSTEM has
   COMPARABLE_PERFORMANCE in terms of TOTAL_COST and FILL_RATE against flex_fi,
   while both SYSTEMS_OUTPERFORM_STO and flex_ni.  considering the associated
   COSTS and limitations to achieve FULL_INFORMATION SHARING,
   PARTIAL_INFORMATION SHARING may be more practical in real_life APPLICATIONS.
   nevertheless, the proposed agent_based framework with DELIVERY_QUANTITY and
   DUE_DATE_FLEXIBILITY but without INFORMATION_SHARING (I.e.  flex_ni) is not
   that worse as compared with the two schemes of INFORMATION_SHARING (flex_pi
   and flex_fi). therefore, by taking the difficulties of implementing
   INFORMATION_SHARING into account, FLEXIBILITY in DELIVERY_QUANTITY and
   DUE_DATE that could be introduced may be a more FEASIBLE_SOLUTION.

   iteratively exchanging offers/counters with limited SHARING of their

   offers/counter_offers takes not only firm'S self_interest and preferences

   perspectives between AGENTS to gradually uncovering the intent of opponents,

AB because of CURRENT_STRONG_GLOBALIZATION_TREND, MANUFACTURERS and planners
   are more willing to cooperate in many aspects such as PURCHASING,
   PRODUCTION, PLANNING and so on.  accordingly, CAPACITY_PLANNING of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN should also be done in order to maximize the OVERALL_INTERESTS
   of SUPPLY_CHAIN. firstly, the difference between CAPACITY_PLANNING of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN and TRADITIONAL_CAPACITY_PLANNING is studied.  then a

AB INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY has become a strong MODELLING approach to support the
   complexities involved in a PROCESS. one example of this TECHNOLOGY is
   THE_MULTIAGENT_SYSTEM which, from a DECENTRALIZED SUPPLY_CHAIN CONFIGURATION
   perspective, supports the INFORMATION_SHARING processes that any of ITS node
   will be able to carry out to support ITS PROCESS in a COLLABORATIVE_MANNER,
   for example, the PLANNING and the decision_making PROCESS. therefore, this
   paper presents a NOVEL_COLLABORATIVE_PLANNING_MODEL in SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS
   by considering a MULTIAGENT_SYSTEM MODELLING approach in order to support
   the decision_making PROCESS from a DECENTRALIZED perspective.  the
   hypothesis presented herein is that by collaborating in the
   INFORMATION_EXCHANGE related with the VISIBILITY of the DEMAND_PLANS, the
   decision_making PROCESS will be improved by reducing, in example, the
   backlogs and the INVENTORY on HAND_COSTS.

AB simulating the AUTOMATIC_NEGOTIATION between ENTERPRISES in SUPPLY_CHAIN by
   the multi_agent SYSTEM is one of the CRITICAL_TECHNOLOGIES to realize
   INTELLIGENCE_BUSINESS. this paper first describes the NEGOTIATION_PROCESS in
   a fixed format.  based on analyzing the predecessor'S_PRICE STRATEGY MODEL
   and VALUE_CONFIRMATION of the CORRELATION_PARAMETERS, the authors develop a
   NEW_PRICE_STRATEGY_NEGOTIATION_MODEL using
   DIFFERENT_PROBABILITY_DENSITY_FUNCTIONS imitating DIFFERENT_PRICE_STRATEGY,
   and analyze the VALUE_CONFIRMATION and ACTUAL_MEANING of the parameters in
   the function.  during the PROCESS of PRICE_NEGOTIATION, the authors
   determine the AGENT'S STRATEGY by ITS next EXPECTATION_PRICE and
   RESERVATION_PRICE, and also take the adversary' S_PRICE into account, which
   makes the NEGOTIATION_PROCESS_CONSISTENT with the phenomenon of " argy_bargy
   " in REAL_LIFE. the authors finally analyze and validate the practicability
   and rationality of the MODEL by the NUMERICAL_EXAMPLES.

AB coordinate and deliver information is vital for the financial and

   and evaluating PERFORMANCE of a MANUFACTURING company and MAKING_DECISIONS

   be purchased, assembled for the FINAL_PRODUCT to be delivered, can
   streamline the PRODUCTION_LINE to provide GOOD_QUALITY_PRODUCTS in the
   RIGHT_TIME and to RIGHT_COSTS at highest profit.  for profit, COSTS are cut
   by reducing storage and searching for LOWEST_PRICE from established
   SUPPLIERS and providers on web as well as handling PRODUCTION_PLANNING
   automatically.  to increase profit, we apply a multi_agent TECHNIQUE to
   PRODUCTION_PLANNING, which can AUTOMATE_BUSINESS decision_making for the
   PRODUCTION_LINE. the AGENTS handle incoming orders, the PRODUCTION_LINE, and
   search for information about the products at the intranet and the EXTRANET.

AB in this paper, we describe the MULTIAGENT SUPPLY_CHAIN_SIMULATION framework
   macsima that allows the DESIGN of large_scale SUPPLY_NETWORK topologies
   consisting of a multitude of AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS. macsima provides all AGENTS
   with an ADAPTIVE_NEGOTIATION_MODULE providing the fine_tuning of LEARNING
   capabilities on the basis of GENETIC_ALGORITHMS as well as of settings
   controlling the exchange of information about finished negotiations with
   other cooperating AGENTS. on this basis the co_evolution and adaptation of
   PRICE_NEGOTIATION_STRATEGIES as well as COALITION_FORMATION_PROCESSES of
   self_interested BUSINESS_AGENTS in b2b_networked domains can be fine_tuned,
   simulated and evaluated.  our EVALUATION of the effects of self_adaptation
   on the OVERALL_TURNOVER and profit of a five_tier SUPPLY_NETWORK scenario
   shows that COORDINATION_OUTCOME and EFFICIENCY vary significantly in
   dependence on (a) the elaborateness of used learn parameterizations, (b) on
   the homogeneity of the DISTRIBUTION of learn PARAMETER_SETTINGS within the
   AGENT_SOCIETY and (c) on the INFORMATION_EXCHANGE_SETTINGS. SYSTEM_OUTCOMES
   are measured on a macro_level in OVERALL_TURNOVER, profit, and

   relationships during IT_SERVICE_OUTSOURCING will be regarded as an
   interface.  after the study of the blossom of the IT_SERVICE_OUTSOURCING
   under the VALUE_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT, the conception of INTERFACE_MANAGEMENT,
   which is introduced as a COOPERATION_MECHANISM in IT_SERVICE_OUTSOURCING, is
   explained according to the INTERFACE_THEORY. on the basis of interface'
   OWN_CHARACTERISTICS, the relationship of all kinds of interface is expounded
   and CORRESPONDING_METHODS, and measures are put forward .the framework of

AB PERSONALIZATION, which has the ULTIMATE_GOAL of satisfying user'S requests,
   can be perceived in terms of QOS_MEASUREMENT. as one of the means for the
   success of SEMANTICS_WEB, many techniques have been effectively used in
   MODELING and developing WEB_SERVICE_PERSONALIZATION. however, most of these
   methodologies relied heavily on detailed implicit and EXPLICIT_INFORMATION
   SUPPLY by users during initial and SUBSEQUENT_INTERACTIONS with the systems.
   we propose in this paper a NOVEL_APPROACH using the SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT
   (SCM) TECHNIQUE in personalizing WEB_SERVICES as against the
   CONVENTIONAL_NOTION of applying SCM only to product MANUFACTURING. our
   user_model based FRAMEWORK_USES multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) COMPONENTS in
   taking requests from users and working towards their SATISFACTION including
   seeking for ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION outside the SYSTEM as the need arises.
   only BASIC_STEREOTYPE_INFORMATION furnished by POTENTIAL_USERS at
   INITIAL_CONTACT is required for PERSONALIZATION during
   SUBSEQUENT_INTERACTIONS with the SYSTEM. the SYSTEM is adaptive and aimed at
   HIGH_QUALITY_AUTONOMOUS_INFORMATION_SERVICES where users are successfully
   presented preferred WEB_SERVICES with MINIMUM_INFORMATION_REQUEST.  2008

AB the INTERNET provides a means for CUSTOMERS to compare prices for products
   from several DIFFERENT_SELLERS. however, the CUSTOMERS act individually and
   they are missing out on the POTENTIAL_BENEFITS that can accrue from acting
   cooperatively and in concert.  the benefits include lower prices, better
   terms, improved services, and increased EFFICIENCY. businesses have begun
   FORMING supply_chain alliances to achieve these benefits, but it has not yet
   been feasible among consumers.  however, using MOBILE_DEVICES can allow for
   the SHARING of information among consumers.  MULTIAGENT networking helps in
   implementing a SIMULATION for MOBILE_AGENTS in a marketplace of consumers.
   using BASIC_KNOWLEDGE in ECONOMICS and societal networking to develop the
   groundwork for the implementation of this ARCHITECTURE will provide results
   to show the benefits that can be gained by consumers.  in this experiment, a

   TRANSPORTATION, like other LOGISTICS_OPERATIONS must add value, which is
   achieved in this case through COMPRESSION_LEAD_TIMES and ORDER_FULFILLMENTS.

AB REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING (rl) appeals to many researchers in RECENT_YEARS
   because of ITS generality.  it is an approach to MACHINE_INTELLIGENCE that
   learns to achieve the given goal by trial_and_error iterations with ITS
   ENVIRONMENT. this paper proposes a case_based
   REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_ALGORITHM (crl) for DYNAMIC_INVENTORY_CONTROL in a
   multi_agent supply_chain SYSTEM. traditional time_triggered and
   event_triggered ordering POLICIES remain popular because they are easy to
   implement.  but in the DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT, the results of them may become
   inaccurate causing EXCESSIVE_INVENTORY (COST) or shortage.  under the
   condition of NONSTATIONARY_CUSTOMER_DEMAND, the S_VALUE of (t, s) and (q, s)
   INVENTORY_REVIEW_METHOD is learnt using the proposed ALGORITHM for
   SATISFYING_TARGET_SERVICE_LEVEL, respectively.  multi_agent SIMULATION of a
   simplified two_echelon SUPPLY_CHAIN, where proposed ALGORITHM is
   implemented, is run for a few times.  the results show the effectiveness of
   crl in both REVIEW_METHODS. we also consider a framework for
   GENERAL_LEARNING_METHOD based on proposed one, which may be helpful in all
   aspects of supply_chain MANAGEMENT (SCM). hence, it is suggested that
   well_designed ''connections" are necessary to be built between crl,
   multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) and SCM.  2008 ELSEVIER_LTD. all rights reserved.

AB INTELLIGENT_WIRELESS_WEB (iww) employs the capabilities of
   HIGH_SPEED_WIRELESS_NETWORKS and exploits the PARALLEL_ADVANCEMENTS in
   internet_based technologies such as the SEMANTIC_WEB, WEB_SERVICES,
   agent_based technologies, and CONTEXT_AWARENESS. considering ITS
   GREAT_POTENTIALS to be applied in BUSINESS_SYSTEMS, we have devised an
   INNOVATIVE_MODEL, based on the IWW_SERVICES, for a typical mobile real_time
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION SYSTEM which has been developed and tested in a
   REAL_OPERATIONAL_ENVIRONMENT. our ARTICLE_INVESTIGATES the proposed SYSTEM
   in this way: at the start, the building blocks of the iww are discussed in
   detail.  then, we fully explain the BASIC_CONCEPTS of mobile real_time
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION and concentrate on the motivations to implement
   such a MODERN_SYSTEM. the vision of INTELLIGENT_WIRELESS_WEB_SERVICES, as
   discussed in this paper, centers on the need to provide mobile
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS highly SPECIFIC_DATA and services in real_time on an
   as_needed basis, with the FLEXIBILITY of use for the user.  in this regard,
   we investigate nine ENABLING_TECHNOLOGIES of the iww for our SYSTEM and
   discuss how, by exploiting the convergence and synergy between
   DIFFERENT_TECHNOLOGIES, it has become possible to deliver
   INTELLIGENT_WIRELESS_WEB_SUPPORT to mobile real_time
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION. afterwards, a PRACTICAL_FRAMEWORK is clearly
   established in four phases.  this INITIATIVE_SYSTEM has been implemented in
   the laboratory and has passed the EVALUATION_PROCESSES successfully.
   further details will be announced in near future in another

AB PETROLEUM_INDUSTRY SUPPLY_CHAIN is a complex SUPPLY_CHAIN with LARGE_NUMBER
   of processes starting right from EXTRACTION_TILL_CUSTOMER_DELIVERY. in this
   paper multi_agent TECHNOLOGY has been applied to make the SUPPLY_CHAIN
   faster as compared to conventional SUPPLY_CHAIN practices.  here a
   representative but EXHAUSTIVE_MODEL is considered, by taking into account
   the VARIOUS_OPTIONS available at each AGENT. solving this problem requires
   an advanced HEURISTIC_METHOD like COEVOLUTIONARY_PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION
   based on CAUCHY_DISTRIBUTION which has been precisely made for COST and
   RESOURCE_ALLOCATION. cauchy provides a very RAPID_PATH towards approaching
   the solution.  the PREVIOUS_WORK done on the co_pso using GAUSSIAN_APPROACH
   is compared with that of CAUCHY_APPROACH and RELEVANT_CONCLUSIONS drawn.

AB the ONLINE_SERVICES of B2B e_commerce have had to face a challenge resulting
   from the DIVERSE_SERVICES built on HETEROGENEOUS_PLATFORMS that must work
   together in an integrated and SEAMLESS_MANNER. today, businesses have
   accumulated LARGE_NUMBERS of ONLINE_SERVICES that run and reside on a
   variety of environments.  furthermore, they have DIFFERENT_WORKFLOWS and
   OPERATIONAL_SUPPORT_SYSTEMS that need to interact with their LEGACY_SYSTEMS.
   the result has been chaotic and disruptive.  we developed a NEW_FRAMEWORK,
   artifact, and PERFORMANCE_MODEL with which to address this problem.  a
   multi_agent e_service SYSTEM was developed to cope with DYNAMICS and
   upheaval.  we used a customer_centric viewpoint with SUPPLY_CHAINS both
   upstream and downstream.  an implementation was performed to determine
   problems in ITS DEVELOPMENT. two simple live CASE_STUDIES were conducted to
   illustrate the MODEL'S feasibility and validity.  2009 elsevier b.v.  all

AB EXPERIMENTS on SIMULATION_MODELS were conducted to determine
   APPROPRIATE_RISK_MITIGATION_STRATEGIES for a SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK under
   SUPPLIER_RISKS. to MODEL the SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK, an agent_based
   SIMULATION_MODEL was designed and implemented using the unified MODELING
   language (UML) standard and JAVA_AGENT_DEVELOPMENT (JADE) platform
   respectively.  in order to MODEL the RISKS in the SIMULATION_MODELS,
   UNEXPECTED_EVENTS were randomly generated to mimic the RISKS that possibly
   occur in the SUPPLY_CHAIN. particularly, four types of RISKS were
   considered, including rare and short, rare but long, frequent but short, and
   frequent and LONG_RISKS. in addition, two RISK_MITIGATION_STRATEGIES, le,
   having a REDUNDANT_SUPPLIER and reserving more INVENTORY, were applied and
   compared.  by considering AVERAGE_TOTAL operating COST and
   AVERAGE_PRODUCT_SHORTAGE, results are generated for
   APPROPRIATE_MITIGATION_STRATEGY for each type of risk.  2009 ieee.

AB the THEORY of NETWORK_COORDINATION presents an EFFECTIVE_APPROACH to improve
   the BUSINESS_PROCESSES within SUPPLY_NETWORKS. the AUTOMATION of the
   NEGOTIATION_PROCESS among buyers and SUPPLIERS has become an
   IMPORTANT_POLICY in the TRANSACTIONAL_NETWORKS. this leads to assessing the
   roles of both quantifiable and non_quantifiable parameters in
   COORDINATION_MECHANISMS with the aim of achieving higher PERFORMANCE. here,
   we develop an e_based SUPPLY_CHAIN multi_agent MODEL for the DESIGN of
   mass_customized on_line services.  the MODEL_ADDRESSES the BULLWHIP_EFFECT
   in multi_stage SUPPLY_CHAIN and also clarifies the EVALUATION of

   the feasibility of the approach, we implement a PROTOTYPE_SYSTEM and
   evaluate ITS PERFORMANCE by SIMULATION using colored PETRI_NETS (CPNS). the

AB the changing BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT in which MANUFACTURERS are acting creates

AB the production_distribution PLANNING_PROBLEM (pdpp) is one of the most
   IMPORTANT_APPROACHES to support GLOBAL_OPTIMIZATION in
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT and should be solved within the
   INTEGRATED_STRUCTURE. this APPROACH_INVOLVES the determination of the best
   CONFIGURATION regarding LOCATION, size, TECHNOLOGY_CONTENT, and
   PRODUCT_RANGE to achieve the firm'S long_term GOALS. on the other hand,
   teams of AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS, co_operating by SHARING SOLUTIONS through a
   COMMON_MEMORY, have been proposed as a means of solving
   COMBINATORIAL_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEMS. in this paper, two scenarios are
   presented for solving pdpp.  in the first scenario, a centralized method is
   employed, and a GENETIC_ALGORITHM (GA) is presented for solving
   PDPP_PROBLEM. here, the crossover is a SINGLE_POINT in plant_plant_plant.
   in the second scenario, an agent_based SYSTEM is developed for solving
   PDPP_PROBLEM. in this case, THREE_GAS are assumed to be the AGENTS of the
   MODEL. this distributed structure can help the SYSTEM to select the most
   APPROPRIATE_SOLUTION for INTERACTION between AGENTS, which are
   GENETIC_ALGORITHMS (ga1, ga2, ga3). in each case, we compare the results of
   each scenario by those obtained from using LINGO_SOFTWARE and a

AB the AUTOMATION of NEGOTIATION among buyers and SUPPLIERS has provided
   cutting_edge KNOWLEDGE on SCIENTIFIC_APPROACHES to the MANAGEMENT of
   SUPPLY_NETWORKS. concentrating on INFORMATION_FLOW and COOPERATION among
   echelons, studies have designed COORDINATION_MECHANISMS for a two_echelon
   SUPPLY_CHAIN: buyers and SUPPLIERS. however, QUANTITATIVE_INVESTIGATIONS are
   hardly found that take into account the difficulties introduced by
   SHEER_NUMBER of participants in the network when attempting to find, and
   negotiate with POTENTIAL_COUNTERPARTS. here, we introduce the concept of a
   SIMULTANEOUS_COORDINATION_MECHANISM which allows the AGENTS
   SHARE_INFORMATION both vertically, I.e.  SUPPLIERS and buyers, and
   horizontally, I.e.  the INTERACTION among buyers.  a
   COOPERATIVE_GAME_THEORY_FRAMEWORK and a SEARCH_PROCESS based on the
   SIMILARITY of users' profiles are proposed in order to re_establish the
   GLOBAL_OPTIMALITY. to illustrate the MODEL_CHARACTERISTICS in providing
   DYNAMIC_FLOW, we MODEL a prototype using colored PETRI_NETS (CPNS).  2009

   investigate the effect of firm'S MYOPIC_BEHAVIOR both in stable and

   SIMULATION_RESULTS show that the RETAILER'S MYOPIC_BEHAVIOR reduces the
   revenue remarkably both in stable and DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT. when MARKET has
   more competitors the RETAILER should maintain the long_term relationship
   even further.  the order'S lead_time affects the relationship differently in

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT critically AFFECTS_BUSINESSES_ABILITIES to obtain
   and sustain COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGES. this paper presents a
   SYSTEMATIC_APPROACH to tackle the issue of the BULLWHIP_EFFECT in
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. first, we proposed a multi_agent
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_FRAMEWORK and compare it with the TRADITIONAL_SEQUENTIAL
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_FRAMEWORK. secondly, we hypothesise that the multi_agent
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_FRAMEWORK would be more effective in alleviating the
   BULLWHIP_EFFECT than the sequential SUPPLY_CHAIN_FRAMEWORK. finally, we
   describe a CASE_STUDY that was conducted to test the proposed hypothesis.
   the findings suggested the multi_agent SUPPLY_CHAIN_FRAMEWORK outperformed
   the sequential SUPPLY_CHAIN in alleviating the BULLWHIP_EFFECT.  2008

AB COLLABORATIVE_PROCUREMENT has been considered as a VITAL_LINK in many
   world_class SUPPLY_CHAIN strategies.  most of the PREVIOUS_STUDIES or
   real_cases related to the e_marketplace or AUCTION based
   COLLABORATIVE_PROCUREMENT just covered the PURCHASING of DISTINCT_ITEMS.
   however, each buyer may have the PURCHASE_NEEDS for
   MULTIPLE_HETEROGENEOUS_ITEMS at the same time.  likewise,
   LARGE_SCALE_DISTRIBUTORS or manufactures or who would like to sell items may
   have the combinatorial SUPPLY needs of selling two or more items
   simultaneously according to their situation.  therefore, in this RESEARCH,
   we address a multi_agent based COMBINATORIAL_AUCTION_MODEL for
   COLLABORATIVE_PROCUREMENT as a NEW_BUSINESS_MODEL that combines the strength
   of the COMBINATIONAL_AUCTION and the benefits of COLLABORATIVE_PROCUREMENT.
   a REPRESENTATIVE_COMBINATORIAL_AUCTION based COLLABORATIVE_PROCUREMENT

AB multi_agent systems are a widely accepted solution to handle
   COMPLEX_PROBLEMS. one application of multi_agent SYSTEM is
   AUTONOMOUS_LOGISTICS. in AUTONOMOUS_LOGISTIC_PROCESSES, potentially every
   element in a logistic SUPPLY_CHAIN is modeled as cooperating SOFTWARE_AGENT.
   thus, there exist MODELING languages that are used to MODEL such multi_agent
   systems.  however, these MODELING languages do not allow verifying the
   properties of systems.  HYBRID_AUTOMATA can be used to MODEL_HYBRID_SYSTEMS
   by capturing both discrete and CONTINUOUS_CHANGES of a SYSTEM. fortunately,
   HYBRID_AUTOMATA are equipped with FORMAL_SEMANTICS that make FORMAL_METHODS
   possible to apply to them in order to prove CERTAIN_PROPERTIES of the
   specified systems.  in this paper, we MODEL multi_agent SYSTEM behaviors in
   AUTONOMOUS_LOGISTIC_PROCESSES using the concept of HYBRID_AUTOMATA. with the
   help of MODEL checking techniques, we can prove some properties of a modeled
   SYSTEM before involving in the implementation of a SYSTEM.

AB we describe the COMMERCIAL_APPLICATION of AGENTS to the handling of
   catalogue and stock_control for the selling of books on the INTERNET. the
   PRIMARY_CHARACTERISTIC of the TARGET_MARKET is (very) LOW_VOLUMES over a
   (very) LARGE_NUMBER of items, thus AGILITY and extremely LOW_OVERHEADS are
   the ESSENTIAL_FACTORS for a VIABLE_BUSINESS_MODEL. being a NEW_COMPANY
   (established 2004), without LEGACY_SOFTWARE and with the freedom to make
   NEW_CHOICES, it was decided that the AGENT_ABSTRACTION offered both
   short_term SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING and longer_term business advantages.  this
   expectation has been borne out in practice, in that it has been possible to
   construct an e_trading platform, using a 4_person team over a period of a
   few months, and that is now part of a LIVE_BUSINESS_OPERATION handling just
   over 12,000 transactions daily.  in this paper we explain how AGENTS helped
   FOCUS_ATTENTION on the responsibilities of KEY_SOFTWARE_FUNCTIONS, how
   DIFFERENT_FUNCTIONS should interact with one another and how to identify and
   PROPAGATE_KEY_PERFORMANCE_INDICATOR_INFORMATION through the SYSTEM to detect
   UNEXPECTED_BEHAVIOUR. AGENT_TECHNOLOGY has many POTENTIAL_BENEFITS for
   dynamic fast_moving businesses where SOFTWARE_REQUIREMENTS change quickly
   and BUSINESS_NEEDS grow rapidly, all within a DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT that has
   entirely DIFFERENT_RULES across the axes of geography, MARKET, customer and
   competitor.  using AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS allowed the BOOK_DEPOSITORY to build
   quickly a COMPLEX_NETWORK of P2P_RELATIONSHIPS with a LARGE_NUMBER of
   SUPPLIERS and publishers of very DIFFERENT_SIZES who each utilize a variety
   of different trading and DATA_INTERCHANGE_STANDARDS. copyright  2008,

   MULTIPLE_INDEPENDENT_SOFTWARE_ENTITIES, like AGENTS. the most
   SIGNIFICANT_CURRENT_TRENDS in this area are shown, focusing on

AB in this paper, we propose a multi_agent NEGOTIATION_MODEL for the
   WHOLESALE_PRICE_CONTRACT (price: w, quantity: q) in a SUPPLY_CHAIN with a
   RETAILER_BUYING from several subcontractors.  we assumed that the
   RETAILER_STOCKS up from several subcontractors in order to face a MARKET
   with fixed DEMAND. each subcontractor has a NORMAL_PRODUCTION_CAPACITY (cn)
   which can be increased until a MAXIMAL_CAPACITY (cm) but with an
   ADDITIONAL_COST. the DEMAND is superior to the sum of NORMAL_CAPACITIES and
   inferior to the sum of MAXIMAL_CAPACITIES. thereby, the negotiated and
   agreed price between the RETAILER and each SUBCONTRACTOR_RELIES on the
   ordered quantity and the EXTRA_COST generated by any EXCESS_CAPACITY (above
   the CN_LEVEL). under ASYMMETRIC_INFORMATIONAL_CONTEXT, we propose a
   multi_agent MODEL which is a duplication of the considered SUPPLY_CHAIN;
   SUBCONTRACTOR_AGENTS negotiate a combination (price, quantity) in order to
   maximize their benefits and a RETAILER_AGENT_NEGOTIATES several combinations
   (price, quantity) with the DIFFERENT_SUBCONTRACTOR_AGENTS in order to
   satisfy DEMAND, allocate quantities and maximize ITS margin.
   EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS_SHOWS that the OBJECTIVE of reaching agreements and
   establish a long_lasting "win_win" partnership is totally reached but
   repartition of benefits is not so fair.

   MODELING, the MANUFACTURING SUPPLY_CHAIN is taken as an example, and a

AB to improve ACCURACY of multi_echelon FORECASTING DEMAND in
   DISTRIBUTION_CHAIN, and optimize ordering and STORAGE_MANAGEMENT, a
   multi_agent_based FORECASTING MODEL (mafm) was proposed.  OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION
   with constrains was established, and GENETIC_ALGORITHM (GA) with
   PENALTY_FUNCTION was adopted to MINIMIZE_TOTAL_COST of DISTRIBUTION_CHAIN.
   ordering variation and COST of four echelons in DISTRIBUTION_CHAIN were
   simulated.  and influence of UNIT_COST_PARAMETER on ORDER_VARIATION and COST
   were analyzed.  finally, mafm was compared to traditional FORECASTING
   methods.  SIMULATION_RESULTS showed that ordering variation of mafm in
   DISTRIBUTION_CHAIN was approximate to the MARKET'S DEMAND, and the
   enlargement of ordering variation (BULLWHIP_EFFECT) was mitigated.
   furthermore, ordering COST also fluctuated smoothly.

AB this paper presents an agent_based approach for MODELING MANUFACTURING
   SUPPLY_CHAINS with ALTERNATIVE_RESOURCE_OPTIONS and optimizing
   CHAIN_CONFIGURATIONS in response to DEMAND_CHANGES across PRODUCT_MIX. a
   MANUFACTURING SUPPLY_CHAIN is modeled as a multi_agent SYSTEM whereby,
   AGENTS in the SYSTEM compete in a form of COMBINATORIAL_AUCTION to perform
   the required OPERATIONS to satisfy CUSTOMER_ORDERS. to some extent, the
   COMPETITION follows a CONTRACT_NET_PROTOCOL (cnet) for DECENTRALIZED
   RESOURCE_ALLOCATION, in which RESOURCE_AGENTS bid for the tasks they are
   able to perform and have their bids evaluated.  the problem with
   TRADITIONAL_CNET_APPROACH is that if tasks are bid for one after the other
   based on either COST or TIME_CRITERION, the resulting combination of
   RESOURCES cannot guarantee to meet the overall DUE_DATE constraint and carry
   out the job at the MINIMUM_COST. to address the time_cost relationship
   problem, a trade_off is made by using an ITERATIVE_BIDDING PROCESS governed
   by GENETIC_ALGORITHM to find the most FAVORABLE_CONFIGURATIONS. a
   NUMERICAL_EXAMPLE is shown and results show that the approach can be used to
   fix the structure of a SUPPLY_CHAIN and also used as a tool for evaluating
   STRATEGIC_ALLIANCES within the CHAIN.

AB in this work, decisions that have a LONG_LASTING effect on the SUPPLY_CHAIN
   (SC) such as the DESIGN and retrofit of a PRODUCTION/DISTRIBUTION_NETWORK
   are considered.  the RETROFITTING tasks are accomplished by using a SC
   agent_oriented SIMULATION_SYSTEM, which MODEL each entity belonging to the
   SC as an INDEPENDENT_AGENT. the starting point is a set of
   POSSIBLE_DESIGN_OPTIONS for the existing SC. for each DESIGN alternative a
   PERFORMANCE_INDEX is obtained through the agent_based framework by looking
   for the best value of the OPERATIONAL_VARIABLES associated to the resulting
   network.  the proposed METHODOLOGY allows to address the DESIGN of
   COMPLEX_SCS which are hard to be modelled otherwise, for example by means of
   STANDARD_MATHEMATICAL programming TOOLS. specifically, the multi_agent
   SYSTEM is suitable for scs that are either driven by PULL_STRATEGIES or
   operate under UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENTS, in which the MATHEMATICAL_PROGRAMMING

   and evaluate the information of the SUPPLY_CHAIN. we introduce a
   SPECIFIC_MULTIAGENT_SYSTEM for dynamic lot_sizing in SUPPLY_CHAINS. the
   dynamic lotsizing problem over a PLANNING_HORIZON makes a plan that
   minimizes COST while satisfying forecasted EXTERNAL_DEMANDS. the

   DESIGN_COORDINATION_MECHANISMS that are capable of motivating
   INFORMATION_SHARING. SUPPLY_CHAIN entities will be willing to

AB building RURAL_LOGISTIC_CIRCULATION_SYSTEM is an IMPORTANT_WAY for building
   SOCIAL_NEW_COUNTRY, in the multi_agent SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM of
   RURAL_LOGISTIC_ENTERPRISE, PURCHASING AGENT should negotiate with the
   SUPPLY_AGENT for price, quality, DELIVERY_TIME and supplying QUOTA_ETC. how
   to optimize the multi_object is an IMPORTANT_PROBLEM. this paper presents a
   multi_object NEGOTIATION_MODEL based on multi_agent.  and the
   NEGOTIATION_STRATEGIES are also discussed.  that will advance the
   QUICK_RESPONSE_ABILITY of RURAL_LOGISTIC_ENTERPRISE SUPPLY_CHAIN, and will
   change the competing type from win_lose to win_win.  and so
   RURAL_LOGISTIC_ENTERPRISE and ITS SUPPLIERS may achieve JOINT_GAINS.  2007

   therefore, flexible PLANNING and realisation as well as FAST_REORGANISATION
   after interferences are INDISPENSABLE_REQUIREMENTS for a

AB the AVAILABLE_TO_PROMISE (atp) function presents one of the most
   IMPORTANT_FUNCTIONS within the firm and the SUPPLY_CHAIN. according to ITS
   appellation, the first role of the ATP_FUNCTION is to provide CUSTOMERS'
   requests with the products' AVAILABILITY_INFORMATION. however, under the
   pressure of a highly COMPETITIVE_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT, the COMPANIES_NEED a
   DECISION_SUPPORT_TOOL to satisfy at best the CUSTOMERS' orders according to
   their AVAILABLE_STOCKS to fit their supplies to a VARIABLE_DEMAND. thus, the
   purpose of this paper is to improve this ATP_FUNCTION, within a
   multi_echelon DISTRIBUTION_NETWORK, to be able to adapt to this
   DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT and to the MULTIPLE_STOCK_LOCALIZATIONS. we suggest the
   COOPERATIVE_ATPE_FUNCTION (c_eatpe) which is based on a multi_agent
   approach, using the "CONTRACT_NET" PROTOCOL. in order to assess these
   FUNCTIONS, we have developed a SIMULATION_TOOL which allowed us to show the
   EFFICIENCY of the suggested FUNCTIONS as well as to study the impact of the
   SYSTEM and the AGENTS' COOPERATION_DEGREE on the global and
   INDIVIDUAL_PERFORMANCES and so, ITS impact on the provided CUSTOMER_SERVICE.

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT recently has been developing into a
   DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT that has to accept the changes in the formation of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. in other words, the SUPPLY_CHAIN is not static but varies
   dynamically according to the ENVIRONMENTAL_CHANGES. therefore, under this
   dynamic SUPPLY_CHAIN_ENVIRONMENT, the priority is given not to the
   MANAGEMENT of the existing SUPPLY_CHAIN but to the selection of
   NEW_SUPPLIERS and OUTSOURCING COMPANIES in order to organize an optimal
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. the OBJECTIVE of this RESEARCH is to develop a multi_agent
   SYSTEM that enables the EFFECTIVE_FORMATION and MANAGEMENT of an optimal
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. the MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM for optimal SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT
   developed in this RESEARCH is a MULTI_AGENT_SYSTEM based on the
   SCHEDULING_ALGORITHM, a COOPERATIVE_SCHEDULING_METHODOLOGY, which enables
   the formation of an optimal SUPPLY_CHAIN and ITS MANAGEMENT. by means of
   ACTIVE_COMMUNICATIONS among INTERNAL_AGENTS, a multi_agent SYSTEM for
   optimal SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT makes it possible to quickly respond to the
   PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT_CHANGES such as the MACHINE_FAILURE or outage of
   OUTSOURCING COMPANIES and the DELIVERY_DELAY of SUPPLIERS. this RESEARCH has
   tried to suggest a NEW_DIRECTION and NEW_APPROACH to the optimal
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT by means of a multi_agent SYSTEM in dynamic

AB a NEW_APPROACH of COORDINATION of decisions in a multi_site SYSTEM is
   proposed.  it is based this approach on a multi_agent concept and on the
   principle of distributed network of ENTERPRISES. for this purpose, each
   ENTERPRISE is defined as autonomous and performs simultaneously at the local
   and GLOBAL_LEVELS. the BASIC_COMPONENT of our approach is a so_called
   VIRTUAL_ENTERPRISE_NODE (ven), where the ENTERPRISE_NETWORK is represented
   as a set of tiers (like in a PRODUCT_BREAKDOWN_STRUCTURE). within the
   network, each PARTNER_CONSTITUTES a ven, which is in contact with several
   CUSTOMERS and SUPPLIERS. exchanges between the VENS_ENSURE the AUTONOMY of
   DECISION, and guarantee the CONSISTENCY of information and material flows.
   only two COMPLEMENTARY_VEN_AGENTS are necessary: one for
   EXTERNAL_INTERACTIONS, the NEGOTIATOR_AGENT (na) and one for the PLANNING of
   INTERNAL_DECISIONS, the PLANNER_AGENT (pa). if SUPPLY problems occur in the
   network, two other AGENTS are defined: the TIER_NEGOTIATOR_AGENT (tna)
   working at the TIER_LEVEL only and the SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEDIATOR_AGENT (scma)
   working at the level of the ENTERPRISE_NETWORK. these two AGENTS are only
   active when the PERTURBATION_OCCURS. otherwise, the VENS_PROCESS the flow of
   information alone.  with this NEW_APPROACH, managing ENTERPRISE_NETWORK
   becomes much more transparent and looks like managing a SIMPLE_ENTERPRISE in
   the network.  the use of a multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) allows
   PHYSICAL_DISTRIBUTION of the DECISIONAL_SYSTEM, and procures a
   HETERARCHICAL_ORGANIZATION_STRUCTURE with a DECENTRALIZED_CONTROL that
   guaranties the AUTONOMY of each entity and the FLEXIBILITY of the network.

AB this study proposes a multi_agent_based MODEL for bilateral multi_objective
   NEGOTIATION in ELECTRONIC_COMMERCE trading.  the function and behaviour of
   several types of AGENTS are discussed.  these AGENTS_INTERACT with each
   other in our NEGOTIATION_SUPPORT_SYSTEM_MODEL to create the most
   APPROPRIATE_SOLUTION for both negotiating parties.  in particular, we are
   concerned with a win_win NEGOTIATION_APPROACH in which AGENTS seek to strike
   a fair deal that also maximizes the payoff for everyone involved.  that is,
   if the opponent cannot accept an offer then the proponent should endeavour
   to find an alternative to make a trade_off.  against this background, a
   UTILITY_MODEL based on FUZZY_CONSTRAINT_SATISFACTION_PROBLEMS is proposed to
   ensure that these AGENTS reach a solution that is fair for both negotiating
   parties if such a SOLUTION_EXISTS. the MODEL_USES prioritized
   FUZZY_CONSTRAINTS to indicate how concessions should be made when necessary.
   in addition, by incorporating the notion of a NEGOTIATION_ARGUMENT into our
   EVALUATION_MODEL, the AGENTS can sometimes reach agreements that would
   otherwise be impossible.  finally, a NUMERICAL_EXAMPLE is given to display
   the applicability of the proposed approach for ELECTRONIC_TRADING

AB the SUPPLY_CHAIN_PLAYS a VITAL_ROLE in the PROCUREMENT, delivery and

   network of BUSINESS_PROCESSES. the major challenges facing the SYSTEM are
   EFFICIENT_COORDINATION and prompt PRODUCTION_PLANNING in meeting and
   sometimes exceeding CUSTOMERS' expectations.  agent_based approach to
   MODELLING SUCH_BUSINESS_PROCESSES has much recompense especially in a
   VIRTUAL_ENTERPRISE where BUSINESS_ENTITIES are distributed over dispersed
   GEOGRAPHICAL_LOCATIONS. this MODEL takes advantage of core AGENT'S features
   and adds autonomous and FLEXIBLE_PROPERTIES to SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM, thus
   making it proactive and responsive to better compete and efficiently
   collaborate in creating customer_centred products.  in this paper, we
   propose a multi_agent SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK for a VIRTUAL_ENTERPRISE (ve)
   involved in the MANUFACTURING of products and capture the LOGIC of the
   PRODUCTION_PLANNING with a SIMPLE_DECISION_TREE. this approach relatively
   simplifies the transformation of the COMPLEX_LOGIC_PROPERTY of the SYSTEM to
   a declarative programming language and FACILITATES_IMPLEMENTATION. also, the
   AGENTS collaboratively get PRODUCT_ORDER from CUSTOMERS, plan and execute
   the PRODUCTION_PROCESSES as well as coordinate the prompt delivery of the
   FINISHED_PRODUCTS. this makes the SYSTEM_AKIN to a DIGITAL_ECOSYSTEM and
   invariably gives SUCH_BUSINESS_ENTERPRISE an edge over ITS counterparts in

AB the SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK_OPTIMIZATION is a DIFFICULT_PROBLEM to solve in the
   context of distributed (information across DIFFERENT_MEMBERS) and dynamic
   (changes in the structure and content of the information) ENVIRONMENT with
   MULTIDISCIPLINARY_DECISIONS. in this paper, we address this problem from a
   DYNAMIC_OPTIMIZATION of LOCAL_DECISIONS point of view, to ensure a
   GLOBAL_OPTIMUM for the SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE. this is done under the
   frameworks of COLLECTIVE_INTELLIGENCE (coin) THEORY and multi_agent systems
   (MAS). by coin, we mean a LARGE_MAS where there is no centralized CONTROL
   and COMMUNICATION, but also, where there is a GLOBAL_TASK to complete: the
   global SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK_OPTIMIZATION. the proposed MODEL_FOCUSES on the
   INTERACTIONS at local and GLOBAL_LEVELS between AGENTS in order to improve
   the overall SUPPLY_CHAIN BUSINESS_PROCESS behavior.  besides,
   COLLECTIVE_LEARNING consists of adapting the LOCAL_BEHAVIOR of each AGENT
   (micro_learning) to the OPTIMIZATION of the behavior globally
   (macro_learning). REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS are used at the
   LOCAL_LEVEL, while generalization of the q_neural ALGORITHM is proposed to
   optimize the GLOBAL_BEHAVIOR. the MODEL is implemented within the

AB in this paper, we propose a NOVEL_APPROACH to MODEL_AGILITY and introduce
   DYNAMIC_AGILITY_INDEX (dali) through FUZZY INTELLIGENT_AGENTS. generally, it
   is difficult to EMULATE_HUMAN_DECISION_MAKING if the recommendations of the
   AGENTS are provided as crisp, NUMERICAL_VALUES. the
   MULTIPLE_INTELLIGENT_AGENTS used in this STUDY_COMMUNICATE their
   RECOMMENDATION as FUZZY_NUMBERS to ACCOMMODATE_AMBIGUITY in the opinion and
   the data used for MODELING AGILITY_ATTRIBUTES for integrated SUPPLY_CHAINS.
   moreover, when AGENTS operate based on DIFFERENT_CRITERIA pertaining to
   AGILITY like FLEXIBILITY, PROFITABILITY, quality, INNOVATIVENESS,
   pro_activity, speed of response, COST, ROBUSTNESS_ETC for integrated
   SUPPLY_CHAINS, the ranking and aggregation of these FUZZY_OPINIONS to arrive
   at a CONSENSUS is complex.  the proposed FUZZY INTELLIGENT_AGENTS_APPROACH
   provides a unique and UNPRECEDENTED_ATTEMPT to determine CONSENSUS in these
   FUZZY_OPINIONS and effectively MODEL DYNAMIC_AGILITY. the efficacy of the
   proposed approach is demonstrated with the help of an ILLUSTRATIVE_EXAMPLE.

AB PEER_TO_PEER (p2p) COMPUTING_TECHNOLOGY provides the
   BASIC_OPERATION_FACILITY for collaborations among nodes of open and
   DYNAMIC_NETWORK (esp.  INTERNET) and complicated distributed
   BUSINESS_PROCESSING. however, it is difficult to accomplish SUCH_WORKS
   successfully because of some INHERENT_FACTS of P2P_ENVIRONMENT, such as
   peers could randomly join in or quit the P2P_NETWORK, which make it hard to
   choose APPROPRIATE_TASK_UNDERTAKERS before the project is constructed.  in
   this paper, a flexible and DYNAMIC_COLLABORATION_ALLIANCE_MECHANISM of p2p
   based on mobile multi_agent TECHNOLOGY is proposed.  the
   COLLABORATION_ALLIANCE_MECHANISM can be deployed in complex and
   CHANGEFUL_ENVIRONMENTS to overcome the DIFFICULT_PROBLEM of peers'
   COLLABORATION, which is working as the following ways: driven by one DEMAND,
   the LEADER_PEER_CONSTRUCTS the project; after the WORK_UNDERTAKERS are all
   selected, the temporary and optimized COLLABORATION_ALLIANCE is formed;
   according to the WORKFLOW, the LEADER_PEER and other WORK_PEERS_COLLABORATE
   to accomplish the tasks of the project based on their COMMITMENTS. the
   mechanism is also utilized to build the agile SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM)
   SYSTEM to verify ITS PRACTICAL_VALUE.

AB businesses are undergoing a MAJOR_PARADIGM shift, moving from
   TRADITIONAL_MANAGEMENT into a world of AGILE_ORGANIZATIONS and processes.
   an AGILE_ENTERPRISE should be able to respond rapidly to MARKET_CHANGES. for
   this reason, ENTERPRISES have been seeking to develop
   NUMEROUS_INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY (it) systems to assist with their
   BUSINESS_PROCESSES. however, by their very nature, information/KNOWLEDGE in
   the systems is disparate and heterogeneous and can be represented in
   VARIOUS_WAYS (text, pdf, html, etc.) and can be either structured or
   unstructured.  it is, therefore, difficult to acquire, organize, or
   distribute information/KNOWLEDGE using only
   TRADITIONAL_INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY_METHODS such as e_mail or FILE_SERVERS.
   because of the autonomous and COLLABORATIVE_ASPECTS inherent in agent_based
   TECHNOLOGY, this may be a POSSIBLE_SOLUTION to the problem of HETEROGENEITY.
   AGENT_TECHNOLOGY radically alters not only the way in which
   COMPUTERS_INTERACT, but also the way COMPLEX_PROCESSES, e.g., SUPPLY_CHAINS
   are conceptualized and built.  this chapter proposes an agent_based SYSTEM
   and FORMULATES_AGILE_INTERACTION for the COLLABORATION of SUPPLY_CHAIN
   entities in a HETEROGENEOUS_ENVIRONMENT. the agent_based SYSTEM_ENHANCES
   SUPPLY_CHAIN AGILITY through the approach in which the AGENTS autonomously
   plan and pursue their objectives and subgoals to cooperate, coordinate, and
   negotiate with others and to respond flexibly and intelligently to dynamic
   and UNPREDICTABLE_SITUATIONS. annotation and ARTICULATION_MECHANISMS are
   developed to address and solve the HETEROGENEITY_PROBLEM of

AB an agent_based tool for micro_level SIMULATION of TRANSPORT_CHAINS (tapas)
   is described.  it is more powerful than TRADITIONAL_APPROACHES as it is able
   to capture the INTERACTIONS between INDIVIDUAL_ACTORS of a TRANSPORT_CHAIN,
   as well as their HETEROGENEITY and DECISION_MAKING_PROCESSES. whereas
   TRADITIONAL_APPROACHES rely on assumed STATISTICAL_CORRELATION between
   DIFFERENT_PARAMETERS, TAPAS_RELIES on causality, I.e., the decisions and
   negotiations that LEAD to the transports being performed.  an
   ADDITIONAL_ADVANTAGE is that tapas is able to capture TIME_ASPECTS, such as,
   the influence of timetables, ARRIVAL_TIMES, and time_differentiated taxes
   and fees.  tapas is composed of two LAYERS, one layer simulating the
   PHYSICAL_ACTIVITIES taking place in the TRANSPORT_CHAIN, e.g., PRODUCTION,
   storage, and transports of goods, and another layer simulating the
   DIFFERENT_ACTORS' DECISION_MAKING_PROCESSES and INTERACTION. the
   DECISION_LAYER is implemented as a multi_agent SYSTEM using the
   JADE_PLATFORM, where each AGENT_CORRESPONDS to a PARTICULAR_ACTOR. we
   demonstrate the use of tapas by investigating how the actors in a
   TRANSPORT_CHAIN are expected to act when DIFFERENT_TYPES of
   GOVERNMENTAL_CONTROL_POLICIES are applied, such as, FUEL_TAXES, ROAD_TOLLS,
   and VEHICLE_TAXES. by analyzing the COSTS and environmental effects, tapas
   provides guidance in DECISION_MAKING regarding SUCH_CONTROL_POLICIES. we
   argue that tapas may also complement existing approaches in DIFFERENT_WAYS,
   for instance by generating INPUT_DATA such as TRANSPORT_DEMAND. since
   TAPAS_MODELS a larger part of the SUPPLY_CHAIN, the TRANSPORT_DEMAND is a
   NATURAL_PART of the output.  studies may CONCERN_OPERATIONAL_DECISIONS like
   choice of CONSIGNMENT_SIZE and frequency of deliveries, as well as
   STRATEGIC_DECISIONS like where to locate storages, terminals, etc., choice
   of producer, and adaptation of VEHICLE_FLEETS. copyright  2008,

AB the new economic challenges and RECENT_TRENDS in globalization have made it
   very difficult for CANADIAN_FOREST_PRODUCT_COMPANIES to improve their
   FINANCIAL_POSITION without the coordinated involvement of the
   ENTIRE_COMPANY, including their SUPPLY_CHAINS (distributed facilities,
   COMPANY_OFFICES, INDUSTRIAL_CUSTOMERS, and DISTRIBUTORS). such a NEW_LEVEL
   of EFFICIENCY_INVOLVES their distributed facilities and offices spread
   around the world, and their CUSTOMERS. one consequence of this NEW_REALITY
   is that FOREST_PRODUCTS_COMPANIES are now facing the need to re_engineer
   their ORGANIZATIONAL_PROCESSES and BUSINESS_PRACTICES with their partners.
   to do this they must adopt NEW_TECHNOLOGIES to support the COORDINATION of
   their PLANNING and CONTROL_EFFORTS in a customer_centered ENVIRONMENT. this
   paper first proposes a GENERIC_SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE for DEVELOPMENT of an
   EXPERIMENTATION_ENVIRONMENT to DESIGN and test distributed ADVANCED_PLANNING
   and SCHEDULING_SYSTEMS. this ARCHITECTURE enables combination of agent_based
   TECHNOLOGY and OPERATIONS research_based TOOLS in order to first take
   advantage of the ability of AGENT_TECHNOLOGY to integrate distributed
   DECISION_PROBLEMS, and, second, to take advantage of the ability of
   OPERATIONS_RESEARCH to develop and exploit
   SPECIFIC_NORMATIVE_DECISION_MODELS. next, this paper describes how this
   ARCHITECTURE has been configured into an ADVANCED_PLANNING and

AB in a dynamic customer_centric SUPPLY_CHAIN_CONTEXT, classic FORECASTING
   MODELS turn out to have a limited applicability.  in order to estimate the
   KEY_PERFORMANCE_INDICES of these SUPPLY_CHAINS and to facilitate their
   MANAGEMENT, it is necessary to use more elaborate TOOLS such as a
   SIMULATION. however BUILDING_SIMULATION of customer_centric SUPPLY_CHAINS is
   no TRIVIAL_MATTER. it requires the elaboration of a REPRESENTATIVE_MODEL and
   the execution of this MODEL according to a set of hypotheses associated to
   scenarios.  due to their properties, multi_agent systems seem particularly
   well suited for the MODELLING and the SIMULATION of SUPPLY_CHAINS and more
   especially in a MASS_CUSTOMIZATION_CONTEXT. in this paper we propose an
   AGENT MODELLING framework for the MODELLING_AND_SIMULATION of such
   SUPPLY_CHAINS to facilitate their MANAGEMENT. we show how this framework can
   be applied to a case of customer_centric SUPPLY_CHAIN from the

AB networked multi_agent systems are comprised of many autonomous yet
   INTERDEPENDENT_AGENTS situated in a virtual SOCIAL_NETWORK. two examples of
   SUCH_SYSTEMS are SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS and SENSOR_NETWORKS. a
   COMMON_CHALLENGE in many networked multi_agent systems is DECENTRALIZED
   TEAM_FORMATION among the spatially and logically extended AGENTS. even in
   cooperative multi_agent systems, EFFICIENT_TEAM_FORMATION is made difficult
   by the limited LOCAL_INFORMATION available to the INDIVIDUAL_AGENTS. we
   present a MODEL of distributed multi_agent TEAM_FORMATION in networked
   multi_agent systems, describe a POLICY_LEARNING_FRAMEWORK for joining teams
   based on LOCAL_INFORMATION, and give EMPIRICAL_RESULTS on improving
   TEAM_FORMATION_PERFORMANCE. in particular, we show that
   LOCAL_POLICY_LEARNING from limited information leads to a
   SIGNIFICANT_INCREASE in ORGANIZATIONAL_TEAM_FORMATION_PERFORMANCE compared
   to a RANDOM_POLICY.  springer science+business media, llc 2007.

AB the behavior of e_commerce AGENTS can be defined at DIFFERENT_LEVELS of
   abstraction.  a formalism allowing to define them in terms of their
   ECONOMIC_ACTIVITIES, UTILITY_STATE_MACHINES, has been proposed.  due to ITS
   HIGH_LEVEL of abstraction, this FORMALISM_FOCUSES on describing the
   ECONOMIC_GOALS rather on how they are achieved.  though this approach is
   suitable to specify the objectives of e_commerce AGENTS, as well as to
   construct FORMAL_ANALYSIS_METHODOLOGIES, this framework is not suitable to
   define the STRATEGIC_BEHAVIOR of AGENTS. in this paper we develop a
   NEW_FORMALISM to explicitly define the STRATEGIC_BEHAVIOR of AGENTS in a
   MODULAR_WAY. in particular, we reinterpret the role of UTILITY_FUNCTIONS,
   already used in usms in a more RESTRICTIVE_MANNER, so that they define
   STRATEGIC_PREFERENCES and activities of AGENTS. we apply the formalism to
   define the AGENTS in a benchmark e_commerce AGENT ENVIRONMENT, the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_GAME. since the STRATEGIC_BEHAVIOR of AGENTS is
   located in a SPECIFIC_PART of the formalism, DIFFERENT_STRATEGIES can be
   easily considered, which enhances the REUSABILITY of the proposed
   specification.  springer_verlag berlin heidelberg 2007.

   SUPPLY_AND_DEMAND is high.  our approach can make buy_agent find a suitable
   supply_agent.  first, the method of the MULTILAYER_CLASSIFICATION is adopted
   to organize and group the information about the SUPPLIERS and buyers
   rationally.  second, in order to increase the SYSTEM_EFFICIENCY, the

AB this PAPER_DISCUSSES_IMPACTS of SHARING information about
   MARKET_DEMAND_PATTERNS on SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE through a
   SIMULATION_APPROACH. a 3_echelon DISTRIBUTION SUPPLY_CHAIN consisting of
   RETAILERS, DISTRIBUTORS and a capacitated manufacturer is modeled as a
   MULTIAGENT_SYSTEM. three DEMAND_PATTERNS are studied, including stable,
   volatile and SEASONAL_DEMANDS. EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS show that values of
   INFORMATION_SHARING strategies is highly dependent on end_market
   DEMAND_PATTERNS; SUPPLY_CHAIN echelons and PERFORMANCE_INDICATORS.
   INFORMATION_SHARING generally leads to reduction in inventories, but
   increases the risk of backlogs.  this may ultimately increase the total
   operating COSTS, depending on which RATE_DOMINATES: unit holding COST or
   unit out_of_stock COST. the result also shows that SHARING information may
   not necessarily improve SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE in a TURBULENT_MARKET
   manifested in the SEASONAL_DEMAND_PATTERN. this observation is largely due
   to the fact that the TIMING_PARAMETERS and variables have not been

AB the BULLWHIP_EFFECT is an AMPLIFICATION of the variability of the orders
   placed by COMPANIES in a SUPPLY_CHAIN. this VARIABILITY_REDUCES the
   EFFICIENCY of SUPPLY_CHAINS, since it INCURS_COSTS due to higher
   INVENTORY_LEVELS and SUPPLY_CHAIN AGILITY_REDUCTION. eliminating the
   BULLWHIP_EFFECT is surely simple; every company just has to order following
   the MARKET_DEMAND, I.e., each company should use a lot_for_lot type of
   ORDERING_POLICY. however, many reasons, such as INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT,
   lot_sizing, and MARKET, SUPPLY, or OPERATION_UNCERTAINTIES,
   MOTIVATE_COMPANIES not to use this STRATEGY. therefore, the BULLWHIP_EFFECT
   cannot be totally eliminated.  however, it can be reduced by
   INFORMATION_SHARING, which is the form of COLLABORATION considered in this
   paper.  more precisely, we study how to SEPARATE_DEMAND into ORIGINAL_DEMAND
   and adjustments.  we describe two principles explaining how to use the
   shared information to reduce the AMPLIFICATION of ORDER_VARIABILITY induced
   by LEAD_TIMES, which we propose as a cause of the effect.  SIMULATIONS
   confirm the value of these two principles with regard to COSTS and

AB the unlimited growth of SUPPLY_CHAIN FINANCE data will inevitably LEAD to a

   systems.  the study of the existing APPROACHES_SHOWS that no single

   pre_produce to SHORTEN_ORDER_LEAD_TIME for downstream CUSTOMER_ORDERS. as
   ORDER_LEAD_TIME is reduced, BULLWHIP_EFFECT of SUPPLY_CHAINS would also be

AB automated NEGOTIATION_SYSTEMS with SOFTWARE_AGENTS representing individuals
   or organizations and capable of reaching agreements through NEGOTIATION are
   becoming increasingly important and pervasive.  examples, to mention a few,
   include the INDUSTRIAL_TREND toward agent_based SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT, the
   BUSINESS_TREND toward VIRTUAL_ENTERPRISES, and the PIVOTAL_ROLE that
   ELECTRONIC_COMMERCE is increasingly assuming in many organizations.
   ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE (ai) researchers have paid a great deal of attention
   to AUTOMATED_NEGOTIATION over the PAST_DECADE and a number of
   PROMINENT_MODELS have been proposed in the literature.  these MODELS_EXHIBIT
   fairly DIFFERENT_FEATURES, make use of a DIVERSE_RANGE of concepts, and
   SHOW_PERFORMANCE_CHARACTERISTICS that vary significantly depending on the
   NEGOTIATION_CONTEXT. as a consequence, assessing and relating
   INDIVIDUAL_RESEARCH_CONTRIBUTIONS is a DIFFICULT_TASK. currently, there is a
   need to build a framework to define and characterize the ESSENTIAL_FEATURES
   that are necessary to conduct AUTOMATED_NEGOTIATION and to compare the usage
   of KEY_CONCEPTS in DIFFERENT_PUBLICATIONS. furthermore, the DEVELOPMENT of
   such a framework can be an IMPORTANT_STEP to identify the CORE_ELEMENTS of
   autonomous negotiating AGENTS, to provide a coherent set of concepts related
   to AUTOMATED_NEGOTIATION, to ASSESS_PROGRESS in the field, and to highlight
   NEW_RESEARCH_DIRECTIONS. accordingly, this PAPER_INTRODUCES a
   GENERIC_FRAMEWORK for AUTOMATED_NEGOTIATION. it describes, in detail, the
   COMPONENTS of the framework, assesses the sophistication of the majority of
   work in the AI_LITERATURE on these COMPONENTS, and discusses a number of
   PROMINENT_MODELS of NEGOTIATION. this paper also highlights some of the
   major challenges for future automated NEGOTIATION_RESEARCH.  2009 springer

AB this paper describes a multi_agent SIMULATION_MODEL of the TRUST and tracing
   GAME. the TRUST and tracing GAME is a gaming SIMULATION for HUMAN_PLAYERS,
   developed as a RESEARCH_TOOL for DATA_COLLECTION on HUMAN_BEHAVIOUR in food
   SUPPLY_CHAINS with ASYMMETRIC_INFORMATION about FOOD_QUALITY and
   FOOD_SAFETY. IMPORTANT_ISSUES in the GAME are OPPORTUNISTIC_BEHAVIOUR
   (DECEIT), TRUST and INSTITUTIONAL_ARRANGEMENTS for enforcing compliance.
   the goal is to improve the understanding of HUMAN_DECISION_MAKING with
   respect to these issues.  to this end multi_agent SIMULATION can be applied
   to simulate the effect of MODELS of INDIVIDUAL_DECISION_MAKING in
   PARTNER_SELECTION, NEGOTIATION, DECEIT and TRUST on SYSTEM_BEHAVIOUR. the
   combination of HUMAN gaming SIMULATION and multi_agent SIMULATION offers a
   basis for MODEL_REFINEMENT in a cycle of validation, experimentation, and
   formulation of NEW_HYPOTHESES. this paper describes a first round of
   MODEL_FORMULATION and validation.  the MODELS presented are validated by a
   series of EXPERIMENTS performed by the implemented SIMULATION_SYSTEM, of
   which the outcomes are compared on aggregated level to the outcomes of games
   played by humans.  the EXPERIMENTS cover in a SYSTEMATIC_WAY the
   IMPORTANT_VARIATIONS in PARAMETER_SETTINGS possible in the GAME and in the

AB real_time SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT in a rapidly CHANGING_ENVIRONMENT requires
   reactive and DYNAMIC_COLLABORATION among participating entities.  in this
   work, we MODEL SUPPLY_CHAIN as a multi_agent SYSTEM where AGENTS are subject
   to an ADJUSTABLE_AUTONOMY. the AUTONOMY of an AGENT_REFERS to ITS capability
   to make and influence decisions within a multi_agent SYSTEM.
   ADJUSTABLE_AUTONOMY means changing the AUTONOMY of the AGENTS during runtime
   as a response to changes in the ENVIRONMENT. in the context of a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN, DIFFERENT_ENTITIES will have DIFFERENT_AUTONOMY_LEVELS and
   OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONS as the ENVIRONMENT_CHANGES, and the goal is to DESIGN a
   real_time CONTROL_TECHNIQUE to maintain GLOBAL_CONSISTENCY and OPTIMALITY.
   we propose a centralized FUZZY_FRAMEWORK for sensing and translating
   ENVIRONMENTAL_CHANGES to the changes in AUTONOMY_LEVELS and objectives of
   the AGENTS. in response to the changes, a coalition_formation ALGORITHM will
   be executed to allow AGENTS to negotiate and re_establish GLOBAL_CONSISTENCY
   and OPTIMALITY. we apply our proposed framework to two SUPPLY_CHAIN CONTROL
   problems with DRASTIC_CHANGES in the ENVIRONMENT: one in controlling a
   MILITARY_HAZARDOUS_MATERIAL_STORAGE_FACILITY under peace_to_war transition,
   and the other in SUPPLY MANAGEMENT during a crisis (such as bird_flu or
   TERRORIST_ATTACKS). EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS show that by adjusting AUTONOMY in
   response to ENVIRONMENTAL_CHANGES, the behavior of the SUPPLY_CHAIN_SYSTEM
   can be controlled accordingly.  2007 ELSEVIER_LTD. all rights reserved.

   AGENT_QUALITY. SUCH_RESULTS along with post_competition
   CONTROLLED_EXPERIMENTS provide USEFUL_EVALUATIONS of NOVEL_TECHNIQUES
   employed in the GAME. we argue that a broader game_theoretic
   ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK can provide a firmer foundation for choice of
   EXPERIMENTAL_CONTEXTS. exploiting a repository of AGENTS from the 2005 and
   2006 tac/SCM tournaments, we demonstrate an empirical game_theoretic
   METHODOLOGY based on EXTENSIVE_SIMULATION and CAREFUL_MEASUREMENT. our
   analysis of AGENTS from tac_05 reveals INTERESTING_INTERACTIONS not seen in
   the tournament.  extending the analysis to tac_06 enables us to measure
   progress from year_to_year, and generates a CANDIDATE_EMPIRICAL_EQUILIBRIUM
   among the best known strategies.  we use this equilibrium as a
   STABLE_BACKGROUND_POPULATION for comparing RELATIVE_PERFORMANCE of the 2006

AB the ability to build lean and agile SUPPLY_CHAINS has not developed as
   rapidly as anticipated, because the DEVELOPMENT of TECHNOLOGY to manage
   SUCH_CONCEPTS of lean/agile for integrated SUPPLY_CHAINS is still under way.
   also, due to ill_defined and VAGUE_INDICATORS, which exist within
   LEANNESS/AGILITY assessment, many measures are described subjectively by
   LINGUISTIC_TERMS, which are characterized by vagueness and
   multi_possibility, and the CONVENTIONAL_ASSESSMENT_APPROACHES cannot
   suitably or effectively handle SUCH_DYNAMIC_SITUATIONS. in this paper, we
   propose a NOVEL_APPROACH to MODEL_AGILITY (which includes LEANNESS) and
   introduce DYNAMIC_AGILITY_LEVEL_INDEX (dali) through FUZZY
   INTELLIGENT_AGENTS. generally, it is difficult to
   EMULATE_HUMAN_DECISION_MAKING if the recommendations of the AGENTS are
   provided as crisp, NUMERICAL_VALUES. the MULTIPLE_INTELLIGENT_AGENTS used in
   this STUDY_COMMUNICATE their RECOMMENDATION as FUZZY_NUMBERS to
   ACCOMMODATE_AMBIGUITY in the opinion and the data used for MODELLING
   AGILITY_ATTRIBUTES for integrated SUPPLY_CHAINS. moreover, when AGENTS
   operate based on DIFFERENT_CRITERIA pertaining to AGILITY like FLEXIBILITY,
   PROFITABILITY, quality, INNOVATIVENESS, pro_activity, speed of response,
   COST, ROBUSTNESS, etc., for integrated SUPPLY_CHAINS, the ranking and
   aggregation of these FUZZY_OPINIONS to arrive at a CONSENSUS is complex.
   the proposed FUZZY INTELLIGENT_AGENTS_APPROACH provides a unique and
   UNPRECEDENTED_ATTEMPT to determine CONSENSUS in these FUZZY_OPINIONS and
   effectively MODEL DYNAMIC_AGILITY. the efficacy of the proposed approach is
   demonstrated with the help of an ILLUSTRATIVE_EXAMPLE.

AB MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES are now moving towards OPEN_ARCHITECTURES for
   integrating their activities with those of their SUPPLIERS and CUSTOMERS
   within wide SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS.
   TRADITIONAL_KNOWLEDGE_ENGINEERING_APPROACHES with LARGE_SCALE or very
   LARGE_SCALE_KNOWLEDGE_BASES are not suited for such widely
   DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEMS. agent_based TECHNOLOGY provides a NATURAL_WAY for
   resolving this problem.  this paper presents a MULTI_AGENT
   INTELLIGENT_ARCHITECTURE for MODELING MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES so as to
   integrate DESIGN, PLANNING, SCHEDULING, SIMULATION, execution, material
   SUPPLY, and MARKETING services into a distributed
   INTELLIGENT_OPEN_ENVIRONMENT. this paper proposes a multi_agent
   INTELLIGENT_ENTERPRISE_RESOURCE_PLANNING (maierp) SYSTEM that uses the
   characteristics and capabilities of SOFTWARE_AGENTS to achieve ENTERPRISE
   WIDE_INTEGRATION. a SOFTWARE_AGENT is a self_contained,
   AUTONOMOUS_SOFTWARE_UNIT that performs assigned tasks from the HUMAN_USER
   and interacts/communicates with other APPLICATIONS and other SOFTWARE_AGENTS
   in DIFFERENT_PLATFORMS to complete the tasks.  four types of
   INTELLIGENT_SOFTWARE_AGENTS (INTERFACE_AGENTS, coordinating AGENTS, PLANNING
   AGENTS, EXECUTIONS_AGENTS) are examined and argued in the proposed
   MAIERP_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE. we demonstrate how the proposed MAIERP_SYSTEM
   takes advantage of existing INFORMATION_SYSTEMS among
   VARIOUS_FUNCTIONAL_AREAS to achieve the SYSTEM_INTEGRATION of
   AVAILABLE_ENTERPRISE_RESOURCE_PLANNING (ERP) systems, while avoiding
   NUMEROUS_PROBLEMS encountered during a TYPICAL_ERP_IMPLEMENTATION.

AB with e_business emerging as a KEY_ENABLER to drive SUPPLY_CHAINS, the focus
   of SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT has been shifted from PRODUCTION_EFFICIENCY to
   customer_driven and PARTNERSHIP_SYNCHRONIZATION_APPROACHES. this strategic
   shift depends on the match between the demands and offerings that deliver
   the services.  to achieve this, we need to coordinate the flow of
   information among the services, and link their BUSINESS_PROCESSES under
   VARIOUS_CONSTRAINTS. existing approaches to this problem have relied on
   COMPLETE_INFORMATION of services and RESOURCES, and have failed to
   adequately address the DYNAMICS and uncertainties of the
   OPERATING_ENVIRONMENTS. the real_world situation is complicated as a result
   of UNDETERMINED_REQUIREMENTS of services involved in the CHAIN,
   UNPREDICTABLE_SOLUTIONS contributed by SERVICE_PROVIDERS, and
   DYNAMIC_SELECTION and aggregation of SOLUTIONS to services.  this
   PAPER_EXAMINES an agent_mediated approach to on_demand e_business
   SUPPLY_CHAIN INTEGRATION. each AGENT works as a SERVICE_BROKER, exploring
   INDIVIDUAL_SERVICE_DECISIONS as well as interacting with each other for
   achieving compatibility and coherence among the decisions of all services.

   are elastic in the price_quantity space; however, only the sellers are
   assumed to be patient, I.e.  only the sellers have a price _ time
   elasticity, whereas the buyers are assumed to be impatient.  sellers select
   their selling price as a best response to all the other sellers' strategies.
   we define and establish the existence of the equilibrium in this MODEL and

   compute other RELEVANT_QUANTITIES such as the equilibrium expected time to
   sale and equilibrium expected ORDER_DENSITY, as well as the expected
   ORDER_DENSITY conditioned on CURRENT selling price.  we derive a closed form
   for the EQUILIBRIUM_DISTRIBUTION when the DEMAND is price independent.  at

   SUPPLY_CHAIN, an ANT_COLONY algorithm_based multi_enterprise INTERACTION and
   SCHEDULING_MODEL was put forward.  in this MODEL, every ENTERPRISE had ITS
   OWN_PRODUCTION_SCHEDULING_SYSTEM respectively.
   COMPLETE_PRODUCTION_INFORMATION was not acquirable between ENTERPRISES. mc
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_OPTIMIZATION SCHEDULING was fulfilled in a cooperative and
   distributed way through repeated and AUTOMATIC_INTERACTIONS between
   ENTERPRISE_AGENTS. finally, a SIMULATION_PLATFORM was built to prove the

AB having EFFECTIVE_DECISION_SUPPORT_TOOLS for coordinated OPERATION of
   SUPPLY_CHAINS (SC) operating in a vague and UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENT is
   essential for success in the highly COMPETITIVE_GLOBAL_MARKET. SUPPLY_CHAINS
   involve the activity and INTERACTION of many entities, which have to make
   coordinated strategic and MANAGERIAL_DECISIONS in a highly DYNAMIC_FASHION.
   even in the data RICH_ENVIRONMENT emerging with the advances in the
   INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY_FIELD, UNCERTAINTY still prevails due to conflicting
   information and INCONSISTENT_DATA. INTEGRATION of SOFT_COMPUTING and
   AGENT_TECHNOLOGIES provides DECISION_SUPPORT for OPTIMAL_DECISION_MAKING in
   SC_DESIGN and MANAGEMENT in UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENT. in this paper, we
   describe a multi_agent SUPPLY_CHAIN_SIMULATOR (mascs) developed to study
   NOVEL_APPROACHES to DYNAMIC_SC_CONFIGURATION and CONTROL using different
   soft_computing technologies: REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING, FUZZY_RULES and
   perceptual FORECASTING. the simulator permits the analysis of the
   DIFFERENT_SEGMENTS of a SC, also can be used at the ENTERPRISE_LEVEL to
   MODEL just_in_time PRODUCTION_PROCESSES. we describe a CASE_STUDY developed
   to obtain semi_optimal SC_CONFIGURATIONS based on DIFFERENT_DEMAND_PATTERNS.

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM) is a very CHALLENGING_PROBLEM that is
   leveraging the e_commerce explosion.  today'S SUPPLY_CHAINS are essentially
   static, because they rely on long_term relationships among key
   TRADING_PARTNERS. DYNAMIC_PRACTICES are vital because they offer better
   matches between SUPPLIERS and CUSTOMERS as MARKET_CONDITIONS change.  this
   paper presents a FLEXIBLE_ARCHITECTURE for dealing with the next generation
   of SCM_PROBLEMS, based on a distributed multi_agent ARCHITECTURE of a
   dynamic SUPPLY_CHAIN. we define INTELLIGENT_AGENT_ROLES that
   TACKLE_SUB_PROBLEMS of a DYNAMIC_SCM. we also present an implementation of
   this ARCHITECTURE used in the INTERNATIONAL_TEST_BED for SCM_SOLUTIONS, the
   trading AGENT_SCM_COMPETITION, as well as some EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS.

AB CONSUMER_GOODS are mainly produced in MULTIPLE_STEPS through a LONG_PROCESS.
   these steps are often done by separate, INDEPENDENT_PRODUCTION_NODES
   (ENTERPRISES), linked by SUPPLY_CHAINS. the NETWORKS of ENTERPRISES _ where
   members have their OWN_OBJECTIVES and act in an autonomous, RATIONAL_WAY to
   reach their GOALS _ can be naturally modeled by agent_based METHODOLOGY. the
   INNER_STRUCTURE of each ENTERPRISE is similar in the sense that it contains
   separated PLANNING FUNCTIONS (e.g., production_, inventory_,
   CAPACITY_PLANNING). while the OPERATION inside an ENTERPRISE can be
   controlled centrally, the INTERACTION between the nodes could be
   synchronized only by NEGOTIATION and COORDINATION. COORDINATION can be based
   on PROTOCOLS which regulate information, material and FINANCIAL_FLOWS alike.
   in this paper we expose an agent_based ORGANIZATIONAL_MODEL of
   PRODUCTION_NETWORKS and suggest some PLANNING ALGORITHMS which can handle
   the UNCERTAINTY of DEMAND. in addition, we outline the first results of our
   ongoing RESEARCH, an analysis of the ASYMMETRIC_INFORMATION_CASE and an

AB GLOBAL_SOURCING is currently the most POPULAR_METHOD for improving
   PERFORMANCE throughout the SUPPLY_CHAIN (SC). because of this, we want to
   assess whether PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT because of GLOBAL_SOURCING is true
   for all SC_NETWORKS. in this paper, we assess the relationship of
   SC_NETWORK_TYPES, GLOBAL_VERSUS local sourcing, DIFFERENT_LEVELS of SUPPLY
   VARIATION_AMPLIFICATION and ORDER_UNFULFILMENT_RATES. a multi_agent based
   SIMULATION_MODEL is used for assessment.  results show that GLOBAL_SOURCING
   alone cannot ENSURE_SC_PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT. results also show that there
   is no best practice for all scs.  a simple trade_off analysis between COSTS
   and ORDER_FULFILMENT_RATES is also taken.  this analysis helps diagnose the

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_COLLABORATION has become a CRITICAL_SUCCESS_FACTOR for
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT and effectively improves the PERFORMANCE of
   organizations in VARIOUS_INDUSTRIES. SUPPLY_CHAIN_COLLABORATION builds on
   INFORMATION_SHARING, COLLABORATIVE_PLANNING and execution.
   INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY is an IMPORTANT_ENABLER of COLLABORATIVE

   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT from LEGACY_SYSTEMS and ENTERPRISE_RESOURCE_PLANNING
   (ERP) into the newly developed ADVANCED_PLANNING and SCHEDULING_SYSTEM (aps)

AB workload balancing (WLB) problem in MANUFACTURING_PLANNING_AND_CONTROL
   (MPC), across the SUPPLY_CHAIN (SC), is being challenged using multi_agent
   systems (MAS) which is a tool capable of solving such a COMPLEX_PROBLEM. the
   COMPLEXITY of the proposed problem stems from the two levels of the problem,
   which are being considered, I.e.  WORK_LOAD balancing on the COMPANY_LEVEL
   and the SUPPLY_CHAIN_LEVEL. at the SUPPLY_CHAIN_LEVEL we consider the
   INDIVIDUAL_WLB_PROBLEMS of the members of the SC and how these will
   interfere with the ENTIRE_SC. MAS can operate autonomously to maintain a
   SMOOTH_FLOW across the SC by controlling WLB and reacting to stimuli I.e.

AB this paper presents a HYBRID_PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION (PSO) ALGORITHM for
   solving the problem of NEGOTIATION_STRATEGY_OPTIMIZATION in buyer_seller
   negotiations in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. the proposed approach is designed
   for the pre_negotiation phase to evolve an appropriate (near optimal)
   NEGOTIATION_STRATEGY with a REASONABLE_TIME. an
   EXPRESSIVE_STRATEGY_STRUCTURE (CONCESSION_DEGREE), an
   EFFECTIVE_SEARCH_ALGORITHM (a division_working PSO with case_based
   initialization) and a kind of NOVEL_BARGAINING_GAMES (negotiating with the
   estimated opponent'S NEGOTIATION behavior MODEL) are developed to improve
   the PERFORMANCE of evolving PROCESS. the division_working PSO_ALGORITHM with
   case_based initialization is the core of the proposed approach.  unlike the
   STANDARD_PSO, this expended PSO_INCORPORATES a multi_layer structure.  the
   SWARM is constructed into two LAYERS: a TOP_LAYER (swarm_local) and a
   BOTTOM_LAYER (swarm_global). DIFFERENT_LAYERS have DIFFERENT_PERSPECTIVES of
   searches, therefore, they have DIFFERENT_VELOCITY updating FUNCTIONS and
   INITIALIZATION_PROCESSES. the DIFFERENT_LAYERS of swarms evolved
   independently but work in COORDINATION with OPTIMIZATION to balance the
   "exploration" and "exploitation" searches.  these features ensure the
   preservation of diversities of the particles, improve the
   RATE_OF_CONVERGENCE and prevent the premature.  SIMULATION_EXPERIMENTS have
   been conducted and the results show that the proposed PSO_APPROACH can
   achieve FASTER_CONVERGENCE and better QUALITY_SOLUTIONS than the
   STANDARD_PSO_ALGORITHM. although the NEGOTIATION_STRATEGY is not necessarily
   the OPTIMAL_SOLUTION, it is guaranteed to be a "good enough" one which can
   serve as a GOOD_REFERENCE and helps the AGENTS to seek the highest
   likelihood of success and MAXIMUM_PAYOFF in the later NEGOTIATION_PHASE.

AB in many situations, real_time OPERATION is required in a SUPPLY_CHAIN, where
   it is desirable to re_optimize the schedules each time a NEW_ORDER is
   submitted.  usually, MULTIPLE_OBJECTIVES (or criteria) and
   DIFFERENT_PREFERENCE_RATINGS for the criteria are associated with a task
   submitted to a SUPPLY_CHAIN. in a PRACTICAL_SCENARIO, it is more convenient
   to specify the PREFERENCE_RATINGS using ORDINAL_VALUES or LINGUISTIC_TERMS.
   the assignment of the tasks from the MANUFACTURERS to the SUPPLIERS for
   real_time OPERATION in a SUPPLY_CHAIN is an
   IMPORTANT_MULTIOBJECTIVE_DECISION_MAKING_PROBLEM. in this chapter, a

   LOGISTICS SUPPLY_CHAIN for VEHICLE_TRANSPORT is analyzed from the point of
   view of TERMINAL_OPERATOR by focusing on the
   CORRESPONDING_BUSINESS_PROCESSES. on this basis the PLANNING_PROBLEM is
   subdivided into three tasks, the QUAY_MANAGEMENT, the allocation of parking
   areas for the TEMPORARY_STORAGE of VEHICLES, and the allocation of drivers
   to the VEHICLES that have to be moved in the TERMINAL_AREA. the problem of
   STORAGE_ALLOCATION is often combined with a DEPARTURE_TIME_ESTIMATION for
   the incoming VEHICLES' here carried out by a LEARNING_CLASSIFIER_SYSTEM. for
   supporting these PLANNING_TASKS a multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) has been
   developed.  in the MAS the PLANNING_TASKS are assigned to
   DIFFERENT_AGENT_TYPES, which are coordinated by a CENTRAL_COORDINATOR_AGENT.

AB there is a trend towards networked and DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEMS, complicating the
   DESIGN_PROCESS of self_adaptive software.  LOGISTICS_NETWORKS can be seen as
   a DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM that have to adapt to requirements of COMPANIES and
   CUSTOMERS in a flexible and FAST_MANNER. when constructing and PLANNING
   LOGISTIC_NETWORKS DIFFERENT_ASPECTS of COMPLEXITY have to be considered: the
   number of stores, INTERMEDIATE_STORES and TRANSPORT_ENTITIES that are
   required at every stage in a SUPPLY_CHAIN as well as the SUFFICIENT_SIZE of
   every store or TRANSPORT_ENTITY. this paper presents an approach that
   SIMULATES_ADAPTIVE_LOGISTIC_NETWORKS using a multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) based
   on EVOLUTIONARY_COMPUTATION (ec). our APPROACH_USES fully DECENTRALIZED
   operators for reproduction like mutation, RECOMBINATION and selection,
   regulated by MARKET_MECHANISMS. the novelty of this approach lies in the
   DECENTRALIZED bottom_up adaption method for DECENTRALIZED systems and we use
   a LOGISTIC_SCENARIO as an example.  our proposed method is based on a
   FORMAL_MODEL explaining how ADAPTION_OCCURS in the number and strategies of

   subproblem to the sizes of problems actually solved by REAL_DECISION_MAKERS,
   we avoid the COMPUTATIONAL_DEMANDS posed by LARGE_PROBLEMS. the
   ALGORITHMIC_CHALLENGE is producing HIGH_QUALITY_SOLUTIONS that reflect the
   INTERACTION between subproblems.  LINEAR_APPROXIMATIONS have been a widely
   used tool for DECOMPOSITION, but these can produce UNSTABLE_SOLUTIONS of
   only MODERATE_QUALITY. we introduce the concept of using
   NONLINEAR_APPROXIMATIONS, which creates SPECIAL_TECHNICAL_PROBLEMS but also
   produces SOLUTIONS of very HIGH_QUALITY. the STRATEGY is simulated on two
   PROBLEM_CLASSES (FLEET_MANAGEMENT and SUPPLY_CHAINS) and compared against
   standard MODELING strategies.  synchronous and ASYNCHRONOUS_STRATEGIES are
   also compared.  2006 informs.

AB a multi_agent based approach for supporting the PLANNING of transshipments
   of imported VEHICLES via a SEAPORT_AUTOMOBILE_TERMINAL is presented.  the
   LOGISTICS SUPPLY_CHAIN for VEHICLE_TRANSPORT is analyzed from the point of
   view of TERMINAL_OPERATOR by focusing on the
   CORRESPONDING_BUSINESS_PROCESSES. on this basis the PLANNING_PROBLEM is
   subdivided into three tasks, the QUAY_MANAGEMENT, the allocation of parking
   areas for the TEMPORARY_STORAGE of VEHICLES, and the allocation of drivers
   to the VEHICLES that have to be moved in the TERMINAL_AREA. the problem of
   STORAGE_ALLOCATION is often combined with a DEPARTURE_TIME_ESTIMATION for
   the incoming VEHICLES _ here carried out by a LEARNING_CLASSIFIER_SYSTEM.
   for supporting these PLANNING_TASKS a multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) has been
   developed.  in the MAS the PLANNING_TASKS are assigned to
   DIFFERENT_AGENT_TYPES, which are coordinated by a CENTRAL_COORDINATOR_AGENT.
   the MAS was subjected to a test using practically

AB SUPPLY_CHAINS in the CHEMICAL_INDUSTRY typically span across several
   corporations and involve several departments within each.  the functioning
   and characteristics of the entities and the intra_enterprise and
   inter_enterprise INTERACTIONS have to be explicitly considered in
   decision_making.  in this chapter, we describe an agent_based MODEL of a
   refinery'S SUPPLY_CHAIN. SOFTWARE_AGENTS_EMULATE the entities such as
   PROCUREMENT, SALES, OPERATIONS, storage and LOGISTICS_DEPARTMENTS of the
   refinery as well as the SUPPLIERS, LOGISTICS_SERVICE_PROVIDERS, and
   oil_exchanges.  these AGENTS_MODEL the embedded BUSINESS_POLICIES and thus
   mimic the DIFFERENT_BUSINESS_PROCESSES of the ENTERPRISE. uncertainties are
   captured by STOCHASTIC_ELEMENTS embedded in the AGENTS. the DYNAMICS of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN is emulated by DISCRETE_EVENT_SIMULATION of the agent_based
   MODEL. the application of the SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL and SIMULATION in
   decision_making is illustrated here.  DIFFERENT_BUSINESS_PROCESSES and
   SUPPLY_CHAIN configurations are evaluated based on their effect on
   entity_specific as well as SUPPLY_CHAIN WIDE_KEY_PERFORMANCE_INDICATORS.
   this enables well_rounded decisions related to both the structure and

AB in today'S MANUFACTURING_ENTERPRISE, the PERFORMANCE of
   CUSTOMER_SERVICE_LEVEL (e.g., short ordering_to_delivery time, LOW_PRICE) is
   highly dependent on the effectiveness of ITS MANUFACTURING_PLANNING and
   CONTROL_SYSTEM (mpcs). however, the function of today'S
   MANUFACTURING_PLANNING_AND_CONTROL is limited inside a MANUFACTURING_SYSTEM
   and cannot effectively enhance the PERFORMANCE_OBJECTIVES (e.g.,
   CUSTOMER_SERVICE_LEVEL) in a SUPPLY_CHAIN_ENVIRONMENT which usually includes
   several COMPONENTS, such as multi_sites, multi_vendors, multi_products,
   multi_machines and multi_orders.  currently, RFID (RADIO.
   FREQUENCY_IDENTIFICATION) TECHNOLOGY has been applied to enhance the
   VISIBILITY, accountability, trackability and TRACEABILITY (vatt) of a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN due to ITS characteristics such as active, long_distance
   reading, and non_line_of_sight.  although RFID allows the accurate and
   detailed MANUFACTURING information (e.g., RAW_MATERIAL, wip, products in
   factory and products in the down streams) of products to be followed in
   REAL_TIME across the SUPPLY_CHAIN, it cannot support a rapid decision_making
   in a distributed and heterogeneous MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT. on the
   contrary, a multi_agent approach may be applied in a distributed and
   AUTONOMOUS_SYSTEM which allows negotiation_based DECISION_MAKING. therefore,
   the OBJECTIVE of this RESEARCH is to study the application of RFID_TECHNIQUE
   and multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) in developing an agent_based
   AGILE_MANUFACTURING PLANNING and CONTROL_SYSTEM (ampcs) which not only
   utilizes the characteristics of VISIBILITY, accountability, trackability and
   TRACEABILITY (vatt) of a SUPPLY_CHAIN obtained from RFID_TECHNIQUE, but also
   employ the characteristics of intelligence, AUTONOMY, MOBILITY, and
   cooperativeness in a distributed DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT of MAS. with ampcs, the
   PERFORMANCE of a MANUFACTURING_ENTERPRISE may be dramatically improved in
   terms of the RELIABILITY, responsiveness, FLEXIBILITY, COST, and

   it is desirable to re_optimize the schedules each time a NEW_ORDER is

   DIFFERENT_PREFERENCE_RATINGS for the criteria are associated with a task
   submitted to a SUPPLY_CHAIN. in a PRACTICAL_SCENARIO, it is more convenient
   to specify the PREFERENCE_RATINGS using ORDINAL_VALUES or LINGUISTIC_TERMS.
   the assignment of the tasks from the MANUFACTURERS to the SUPPLIERS for

   ASSEMBLY_PLANTS and TRANSPORTATION_MODES to select at each stage of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. specifically, the PAPER_CONSIDERS how to configure and
   optimise the SUPPLY_CHAIN for an assembly_to_order PRODUCTION_SYSTEM given
   the expected DUE_DATES of customer'S orders.  the SUPPLY_CHAIN is viewed as
   a network consisting of FUNCTIONAL_NODES. at the nodes of the SUPPLY_CHAIN,
   there are MULTIPLE_OPTIONS of RESOURCES such as SUPPLIERS to SUPPLY
   RAW_MATERIALS/COMPONENTS, PLANTS to assemble products and
   TRANSPORTATION_MODES to convey products to VARIOUS_CUSTOMERS. each of these
   RESOURCE_OPTIONS are often differentiated by their INDIVIDUAL_COSTS and
   lead_times.  with a variety of alternatives along the SUPPLY_CHAIN, the
   CENTRAL_PROBLEM is to select a set of RESOURCES that minimise the total
   SUPPLY_CHAIN COST without compromising the expected DUE_DATES of the
   products.  to address the problem briefly described, we propose a
   multi_agent systems MODEL that USES_ITERATIVE bidding mechanism to
   SELECT_APPROPRIATE_RESOURCES for each stage of the SUPPLY_CHAIN. we employ
   an example to illustrate the benefits of the approach compared with

AB SUPPLY_CHAINS in the CHEMICAL_INDUSTRY typically span across several
   corporations and involve several DEPARTMENTS_WITCHERGSHIN each.  the
   functioning and characteristics of the entities and the intra_enterprise and
   inter_enterprise INTERACTIONS have to be explicitly considered in
   decision_making.  in this chapter, we describe an agent_based MODEL of a
   refinery'S SUPPLY_CHAIN. SOFTWARE_AGENTS_EMULATE the entities such as
   PROCUREMENT, SALES, OPERATIONS, storage and LOGISTICS_DEPARTMENTS of the
   refinery as well as the SUPPLIERS, LOGISTICS_SERVICE_PROVIDERS, and
   oil_exchanges.  these AGENTS_MODEL the embedded BUSINESS_POLICIES and thus
   mimic the DIFFERENT_BUSINESS_PROCESSES of the ENTERPRISE. uncertainties are
   captured by STOCHASTIC_ELEMENTS embedded in the AGENTS. the DYNAMICS of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN is emulated by DISCRETE_EVENT_SIMULATION of the agent_based
   MODEL. the application of the SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL and SIMULATION
   in'decision_making is illustrated here.  DIFFERENT_BUSINESS_PROCESSES and
   SUPPLY_CHAIN configurations are evaluated based on their effect on
   entity_specific as well as SUPPLY_CHAIN WIDE_KEY_PERFORMANCE_INDICATORS.
   this enables well_rounded decisions related to both the structure and
   parameters of the SUPPLY_CHAIN.  PORRINGER_BERLIN_HEIDELBERG 2006.

AB a SUPPLY_CHAIN is a complicated network for linking SUPPLIERS,
   MANUFACTURERS, and DISTRIBUTORS. how to allocate the tasks efficiently is a
   KEY_ISSUE in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. the FORMING of a SUPPLY_CHAIN is
   dynamic in nature owing to the FREQUENT_CHANGES of DEMAND. this
   PAPER_FOCUSES on TASK_ALLOCATION in the open SUPPLY_CHAIN_ENVIRONMENT. the
   aim is to develop a TASK_ALLOCATION_METHOD for autonomous and
   self_interested AGENTS, which have INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION about the
   OPEN_ENVIRONMENT. the proposed mechanism is based on an
   AUTOMATIC_NEGOTIATION_APPROACH, which is used to allocate tasks by
   negotiating among the manager_to_bidder and bidder_to_bidder.  the
   modification of CONTRACT_NET_PROTOCOL (cnp) for manager_bidder and the
   PROTOCOL of the stochastic offer are introduced, and the

   a DYNAMIC_METHOD for TASK_ALLOCATION, which is applicable to the

   in SCM viewing ENTERPRISES in SC as DIFFERENT_FUNCTIONAL_AGENTS
   collaborating to achieve COMMON_GOAL. in this paper a mas_based
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK (msf) is developed on which AGENTS can
   collaborate to CONDUCT_BUSINESS_ACTIVITIES of ENTERPRISES and CUSTOMERS. six
   kinds of FUNCTIONAL_AGENTS are designed, namely, MANAGEMENT_AGENT, order

   manufacturing_controlling AGENT and TRANSPORTATION_AGENT. through the
   AGENTS' COLLABORATION the msf can SUPPORT_SC DYNAMIC_FORMING and

   ALGORITHM to be applied in matching the two matrixes, and ALGORITHMS are

AB build_to_order SUPPLY_CHAIN (bosc) is a NEW_OPERATION_PARADIGM in the
   ENVIRONMENT of GLOBAL_COMPETITION and changing CUSTOMER_DEMAND. ITS
   characteristics of responsiveness, FLEXIBILITY, and HIGH_DEGREE of
   INTEGRATION urgently need the support of an internet_based real_time
   INFORMATION_SYSTEM. based on analysis of KEY_INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY such as
   business_customer e_commerce and multi_agent SYSTEM, main features that
   BOSC_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM should hold were summarized as SYNCHRONIZATION,
   INTEROPERABILITY, intelligence, REAL_TIME, and SCALABILITY. the
   FRAMEWORK_STRUCTURE of BOSC_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM was designed as a core
   multi_agent SYSTEM at build_to_order (BTO) manufacturer with three browsers
   at SUPPLIERS, LOGISTIC_VENDORS, and CUSTOMERS. after describing the
   FUNCTIONAL_SERVICE of each AGENT, the INFORMATION_FLOW and the basic

AB in our PREVIOUS_EXPERIMENTS of a SUPPLY_CHAIN using BEER came, we found a
   counterexample for the bull_whip effect such that INVENTORY_LEVEL of the
   UPSTREAM_FIRM is not always larger than that of the downstream firm even in
   the ENVIRONMENT that the NUMBER_AF_FIRMS is many and the length of delay in
   shipping is longer.  in this paper, we propose several
   QUANTITATIVE_DEFINITIONS of the BULLWHIP_EFFECT and re_estimate our
   PREVIOUS_FINDINGS with these definitions.  to the best of our KNOWLEDGE, no
   SYSTEMATIC_ATTEMPT has been made to define quantitatively the
   BULLWHIP_EFFECT while it is defined qualitatively so far.  this study is the
   first attempt to define the BULLWHIP_EFFECT quantitatively.  we show that a
   frequency based STATISTICAL_MEASUREMENT such as STOCHASTIC_DOMINANCE is not
   appropriate to capture the BULLWHIP_EFFECT quantitatively because it cannot
   distinguish between a case of the BULLWHIP_EFFECT and a counterexample.  on
   the other hand, DESCRIPTIVE_STATISTICS such as mean and STANDARD_DEVIATION
   works well.  2005 ieee.

AB WHOLE_CROP_HARVESTING to maximise co_generation requires a substantial
   change to the SUGAR_VALUE_CHAIN and SUBSTANTIAL_INVESTMENT. thus,
   CAREFUL_ANALYSES are required.  cogeneration of ELECTRICITY can be maximised
   by HARVESTING the WHOLE_CROP, I.e.  using the ADDITIONAL_FIBRE in tops and
   TRASH to FUEL_COGENERATION. however, WHOLE_CROP_HARVESTING will have impacts
   on the WHOLE_VALUE_CHAIN which will be very difficult to predict a priori.
   we worked with STAKEHOLDERS in two MILL_REGIONS to assess, through novel
   SUPPLY_CHAIN MODELLING techniques, the VIABILITY of options for
   co_generation maximisation within locally defined constraints relating to
   preferences for using existing or installing NEW_POWER_GENERATION_CAPACITY.
   the MODELLING used agent_based approaches to FACILITATE_INTEGRATION of
   existing single_sector MODELS into a whole of VALUE_CHAIN_FRAMEWORK_MODEL.
   income from ELECTRICITY and RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATES_SALES was weighed
   against not only the COSTS of constructing (for some scenarios) and
   operating the co_generation facility, but also the COSTS associated with
   loss of TRASH from the field, HARVESTING the WHOLE_CROP and transporting it
   to the mill, separation of TRASH from cane, and the impact of increased
   EXTRANEOUS_MATTER on sugar milling.  in general, predictions of the impact
   of losing TRASH from the farming SYSTEM were greater than anticipated, while
   the impacts in the HARVESTING and TRANSPORT_SECTORS were less than expected
   because of increased EFFICIENCY that might be achieved in these sectors.
   the analysis provided a more COMPLETE_UNDERSTANDING of the POSSIBLE_IMPACTS
   of WHOLE_CROP_HARVESTING than previously available, or than would be
   obtained using more TRADITIONAL_ASSESSMENTS. the analysis also provided
   other benefits, such as defining the value of TRASH and tops and
   POSSIBLE_IMPROVEMENTS in HARVESTING and TRANSPORT_LOGISTICS, which are being
   used to improve the SUGAR_VALUE_CHAIN in the CASE_STUDY_REGIONS.  2006 28th

   their dedicated AGENT that cooperate with the other AGENTS to fulfill their

AB the purpose of this paper is to propose a NEW_APPROACH for the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. this approach is based on the
   VIRTUAL_ENTERPRISE_PARADIGM and the usage of multi_agent concept.  the
   BASE_COMPONENT of our approach is a VIRTUAL_ENTERPRISE_NODE (ven). the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN is viewed as a set of tiers (corresponding to the levels of
   PRODUCTION), in which each partner of the SUPPLY_CHAIN (ven) is in relation
   with several CUSTOMERS and SUPPLIERS. each ven belongs to one tier.  the
   MAIN_CUSTOMER gives GLOBAL_OBJECTIVES (quantity, COST and delay) to the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. the MEDIATOR_AGENT (ma) is in charge to manage the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN in order to respect those objectives as GLOBAL_LEVEL. those
   objectives are taking over to NEGOTIATOR_AGENT at the TIER_LEVEL (nat). this
   ARCHITECTURE allows SUPPLY_CHAINS MANAGEMENT which is completely transparent
   seen from SIMPLE_ENTERPRISE of the SUPPLY_CHAIN. the use of multi_agent
   SYSTEM allows PHYSICAL_DISTRIBUTION of the DECISIONAL_SYSTEM. moreover, the
   HIERARCHICAL_ORGANIZATIONAL_STRUCTURE with a DECENTRALIZED
   CONTROL_GUARANTEES, at the same time, the AUTONOMY of each entity and the
   WHOLE_FLEXIBILITY.

   variations of this DEMAND. finally, the proposed approach is validated by
   the wood SUPPLY GAME, which is a SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL used to make players
   aware of the BULLWHIP_EFFECT. we experimentally verify that our
   COORDINATION_TECHNIQUE leads to less VARIABLE_ORDERS (I.e.  the

   order_interarrival time in four DIFFERENT_MARKET_ENVIRONMENTS.
   SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS of the proposed TRUST_MECHANISMS finds that they reduce
   the AVERAGE_CYCLE_TIME and increase the in_time order_fulfillment rate in
   CERTAIN_MARKET_ENVIRONMENTS at the expense of the MATERIAL_COST. the
   COST_INCREASE is controlled within an ACCEPTABLE_RANGE and can be treated as
   a premium paid for SHORTER_AVERAGE_CYCLE_TIME. a higher TRUSTOR_PROPENSITY
   to TRUST_RENDERS to a higher in_time order_fulfillment rate.  the study will
   help MANAGEMENT_RATIONALIZE the DEVELOPMENT of SOFTWARE_AGENTS embedded with
   TRUST_MECHANISMS that can improve supply_chain PERFORMANCE. in the future,

   with a capacity for adaptation.  the aim of this paper is to propose a
   multi_agent ARCHITECTURE for COOPERATION and NEGOTIATION in SUPPLY_NETWORKS
   (mcnsn), which incorporates a LEARNING_CAPABILITY for AGENTS, and discusses
   the issues which need to be addressed for COORDINATION of buyers and

   reasoning (CBR) as a framework for LEARNING the best STRATEGY between buyers
   and SUPPLIERS. mcnsn operates at two levels.  the first is a
   transaction/ENTERPRISE_LEVEL which requires
   DYNAMIC_CUSTOMER_RELATIONSHIP_MANAGEMENT (crm) information, user profiling
   and will eventually need a BARGAINING_CAPABILITY. the second is at a

AB real_time OPERATION is often required in a SUPPLY_CHAIN, where it is
   desirable to re_optimize the schedules each time a NEW_ORDER is submitted.
   an ORGANIZATION in a SUPPLY_CHAIN may not be able to perform all the tasks
   it has received completely due to lack of RESOURCES. it has to delegate
   those subtasks which it cannot perform to ITS SUPPLIERS in the SUPPLY_CHAIN.
   in a PRACTICAL_SITUATION, the SUPPLIERS may be parts of more than one
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. hence the ORGANIZATION does not have a COMPLETE_CONTROL over
   the schedules of ITS SUPPLIERS. there should be COORDINATION within and
   across organizations for producing the schedules.  usually,
   MULTIPLE_OBJECTIVES (or criteria) like quality, COST, and duration are
   associated with a task.  PREFERENCE_RATINGS, assigned by the end_user or the
   ORGANIZATION itself, may be associated with these criteria.  the
   PREFERENCE_RATINGS may be specified in an IMPRECISE_MANNER by using
   ORDINAL_VALUES or LINGUISTIC_TERMS. the assignment of the tasks to the
   SUPPLIERS, which is a MULTIOBJECTIVE_DECISION_MAKING_PROBLEM, has to be done
   quickly for real_time OPERATION. in this paper, a SUPPLY_CHAIN is first
   modeled using a MULTIAGENT_FRAMEWORK and an ARCHITECTURE for the AGENTS
   located at every ORGANIZATION in the CHAIN is presented.  we then propose a
   real_time scheduler that can SCHEDULE NEW_ORDERS with soft real_time
   deadlines.  an ALGORITHM for the TASK_ASSIGNMENT using the FUZZY set
   approach for the real_time OPERATION in a SUPPLY_CHAIN is then proposed.
   comparison of the ALGORITHM_VERSUS other commonly used HEURISTIC_METHODS for
   TASK_ASSIGNMENT is done in a SIMULATED_ENVIRONMENT. the EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS
   show SIGNIFICANT_PERFORMANCE_GAINS for a LARGE_RANGE of TASK_ARRIVAL_RATES.
   however, the PERFORMANCE_DETERIORATES for very HIGH_ARRIVAL_RATES. in order
   to overcome this limitation, we present a HYBRID_ALGORITHM that augments the
   FUZZY_TECHNIQUE and does not suffer from PERFORMANCE_DEGRADATION even for
   HIGH_ARRIVAL_RATES.  2004 elsevier b.v.  all rights reserved.

AB in this paper, we describe our on_going RESEARCH on UNCERTAINTY_ANALYSIS in
   multi_agent systems for SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (mascm). in a mascm, an
   AGENT consists of AUTOMATION_PROCESSES within a LEGAL_ENTITY in the specific
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK. it conducts SUPPLY_CHAIN PLANNING, execution and
   COOPERATION on behalf of ITS owner.  each day these AGENTS have to PROCESS a
   LARGE_VOLUME of data from DIFFERENT_SOURCES with mixed signals not to be
   anticipated in advance.  thus, one challenge every AGENT has to face in this
   VOLATILE_ENVIRONMENT is to quickly identify the impact of UNEXPECTED_EVENTS,
   and take PROPER_ADJUSTMENTS in both LOCAL_PROCEDURES and related
   cross_boundary INTERACTIONS. to facilitate the study of UNCERTAINTY in the
   COMPLEX_SYSTEM of mascm, we MODEL_AGENT_SYSTEM_BEHAVIORS by ABSTRACTING ITS
   SIGNIFICANT_OPERATIONAL_ASPECTS as observation, propagation and update of
   UNCERTAINTY_IFHROMATION. the resulting THEORETICAL_MODEL, called an extended
   BAYESIAN_BELIEF_NETWORK (ebbn), may serve as the basis for developing an
   UNCERTAINTY_MANAGEMENT_COMPONENT for a large_scale electronic

   COLLABORATIVE_PLANNING FORECASTING and REPLENISHMENT (CPFR) PROCESS for
   TRADING_PARTNERS (belonging to the same SUPPLY_CHAIN) who are willing to
   collaborate in exchanging SALES and ORDER_FORECASTS. the hurdles that arose
   in implementing CPFR in FIELD_APPLICATIONS indicate the need for providing
   COLLABORATION_PROCESS with an INTELLIGENT_TOOL to OPTIMIZE_NEGOTIATION. for
   this purpose, a LITERATURE_REVIEW and classification have been carried out
   for AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS used to managing supply_chain processes.  on the basis
   of the classification, two multi_agent MODELS are proposed, according to
   DIFFERENT_DEGREES of AGENTS' capabilities.  to evaluate the strengths coming
   from an INTELLIGENT_SYSTEM embedded within the CPFR_PROCESS, several
   EXPERIMENTS in DIFFERENT_CONDITIONS have been conducted using a
   SIMULATION_TOOL. the analysis of results indicates that the agents_driven
   NEGOTIATION_PROCESS (by comparison with CPFR without INTELLIGENT_AGENTS)
   benefits in terms of COSTS, INVENTORY_LEVEL, stock_out level and SALES.

AB to date, the SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEMS offer no SOLUTIONS for
   QUALITY_CONTROL of ELECTRICAL_DOMESTIC_APPLIANCES through the TRACEABILITY
   of COMPONENTS (hw or sw) information.  failures in assembled products may be
   detected at many points of the PRODUCT_LIFE, therefore an EARLY_DIAGNOSIS
   could depend on the retrieval of all SIGNIFICANT_INFORMATION recorded along
   the extended SUPPLY_CHAIN. the BASIC_IDEA proposed in this work is to define
   a society of AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS created to support the TRACEABILITY of
   COMPONENTS_INFORMATION in a federated ENTERPRISES_ENVIRONMENT. we discuss,
   as a CASE_STUDY, a simple SUPPLY_CHAIN for the PRODUCTION of
   ELECTRICAL_APPLIANCES such as washing machines, refrigerators or dishwashers
   whose COMPONENTS' TRACEABILITY is defined in terms of a kind of WORKFLOW
   extended for QUALITY_CONTROL (EQUW: extended QUALITY_WORKFLOW).

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT deals with the PLANNING and COORDINATION of bidding,
   PRODUCTION, sourcing and PROCUREMENT_ACTIVITIES associated with one or more
   products.  it is central to today'S GLOBAL_ECONOMY, leading to trillions of
   dollars in ANNUAL_TRANSACTIONS_WORLDWIDE. with the EMERGENCE of
   ELECTRONIC_MARKETPLACES, it is only natural to seek automated SOLUTIONS that
   are capable of rapidly evaluating a LARGE_NUMBER of bidding, sourcing and
   PROCUREMENT_OPTIONS. in this paper, we detail a GAME we have designed to
   promote the RESEARCH and EVALUATION of SUCH_SOLUTIONS under
   REALISTIC_CONDITIONS. the GAME requires AGENTS to manage the ASSEMBLY of
   pcs, while competing with one another both for CUSTOMER_ORDERS and for
   KEY_COMPONENTS. we discuss how the GAME_CAPTURES the COMPLEXITY,
   stochasticity and COMPETITIVE_NATURE inherent to SUPPLY_CHAIN environments.
   a web_based multi_agent SIMULATION_PLATFORM developed for the GAME was
   implemented in 2003 and validated in the context of the first
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT trading AGENT_COMPETITION (tac_scm). a total of 20
   teams from around the world competed with one another.  we
   REVIEW_AGENT_STRATEGIES developed by DIFFERENT_TEAMS and discuss the merits
   of competition_based RESEARCH over more TRADITIONAL_RESEARCH_METHODOLOGIES

AB multi_agent systems (MAS) offer NEW_PERSPECTIVES compared to conventional,
   centrally organized architectures in the scope of SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT
   (SCM). their structure inherently meets the requirements of DECENTRALIZED
   SUPPLY_CHAINS, whereas CONVENTIONAL_SCM_SYSTEMS are often restricted in
   terms of DYNAMIC_BEHAVIOR, handling SEVERE_DISTURBANCES at SUPPLIER_SITES as
   well as dealing with highly customized or COMPLEX_PRODUCTS. since
   NECESSARY_DATA are not available within the whole SUPPLY_CHAIN, an
   INTEGRATED_APPROACH for PRODUCTION_PLANNING and CONTROL taking into account
   all the partners involved is not feasible.  in this paper, a
   MAS_ARCHITECTURE integrating VARIOUS_INTELLIGENT_AGENT_SYSTEMS is presented

AB in SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT, improving the EFFICIENCY of the overall
   SUPPLY_CHAIN is important.  it has been found that SHARING information
   between SUPPLY_CHAIN_MEMBERS can increase the EFFICIENCY of the SUPPLY_CHAIN
   by varying degrees in DIFFERENT_SITUATIONS. there are, however, many
   PRACTICAL_DIFFICULTIES in SHARING information with all the COMPANIES in a
   complex SUPPLY_CHAIN. this paper presents a multi_agent SYSTEM for
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION where AGENTS discover the structure of
   SUPPLY_CHAINS and SHARE_INFORMATION on INVENTORY_LEVELS only by
   LOCAL_COLLABORATIONS. AGENTS use the gathered information to
   ESTIMATE_DEMANDS propagated from MULTIPLE_MARKETS through a COMPLEX_NETWORK
   of COMPANIES with DIFFERENT_LEAD_TIMES and MARKET_SHARES. the PERFORMANCE of
   the suggested SYSTEM is investigated with a SIMULATION_EXPERIMENT and the
   result is compared with an ALTERNATIVE_STRATEGY.  springer_verlag berlin

AB the ever FAST_CHANGES of CUSTOMERS' needs and demands ask for RECONFIGURABLE
   and ADAPTIVE_PRODUCTION_SYSTEMS, which can provide COMPANIES with the
   PROPER_LEVEL of AGILITY and effectiveness, without disregarding at the same
   TIME_COST_FACTORS. in the last decade, a LARGE_AMOUNT of RESEARCH_WORKS on
   the adoption of multi_agent systems (MAS) in several INDUSTRIAL_ENVIRONMENTS
   has flourished.  this approach, unlike traditional centralized or
   MULTILEVEL_HIERARCHICAL_APPROACHES, assumes the presence of several
   decision_making entities, distributed inside the MANUFACTURING_SYSTEM,
   interacting and cooperating each other in order to achieve optimal
   GLOBAL_PERFORMANCE. aim of this paper is at first to provide readers, which
   are not experienced witfi the multi_agent approach, with some definitions
   and categorizations of this paradigm.  secondarily, by making use of an
   EXTENSIVE_DATABASE of more than 100 contributions on this field, authors
   intend to evaluate how multi_agents systems have really impacted on the
   INDUSTRIAL_PRACTICES at an ENTERPRISE and at a broader SUPPLY_CHAIN_LEVEL.

AB there is an increasing interest in exploring the opportunities for
   COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE that arise from reinforcing CORE_COMPETENCIES and
   INNOVATIVE_CAPABILITIES of the INDIVIDUAL_COMPANIES, and by FORMING
   integrated SUPPLY_NETWORKS. in complex and DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENTS such as the
   automotive and SEMICONDUCTOR_INDUSTRIES, managing and co_ordinating the
   PROCUREMENT of materials, their transformation into intermediate and
   FINISHED_PRODUCTS, and the DISTRIBUTION to the FINAL_CUSTOMERS, are very
   demanding tasks in terms of INFORMATION_SYSTEMS. in general,
   CURRENT_AVAILABLE_SOFTWARE_PACKAGES do not provide the FULL_SUPPORT needed
   for networked and distributed organizations, and are clearly insufficient in
   what concerns the PLANNING and COORDINATION_ACTIVITIES needed in these
   HETEROGENEOUS_ENVIRONMENTS. in order to adequately tackle these problems,
   this work proposes a multi_agent SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE for real_time
   customer_order PLANNING in DISTRIBUTED_MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES, addressing
   the requirements of a make_to_order ENVIRONMENT. the PRESENT_RESEARCH_WORK
   resulted from the co_operate european project.  enhanced VISIBILITY of

   COLLABORATIVE_PLANNING in the SUPPLY_CHAIN are the GENERAL_GOALS of the
   project.  in particular, for AGGREGATE_PLANNING and ORDER_PROMISING, a

   of AGENTS and extensively using the INTERNET, was designed and implemented.

AB AGENT_TECHNOLOGY has become popular in the last few years as an
   EFFECTIVE_APPROACH to develop software and HARDWARE_SYSTEMS. our
   RESEARCH_APPLIES this TECHNOLOGY to WAREHOUSE_SYSTEMS. since
   WAREHOUSE_SYSTEM is crucial to the success of supply_chain systems,
   OBJECTIVE of our RESEARCH is to implement a framework of WAREHOUSE_SYSTEM
   based on the AGENT_TECHNOLOGY. this paper proposes an agent_based MODEL for
   WAREHOUSE_SYSTEM, which is called awas (agent_based MODEL for
   WAREHOUSE_SYSTEM). awas is composed of three subsystems, or agent_based
   COMMUNICATION_SYSTEM (acs), agent_based MATERIAL_HANDLING_SYSTEM (amath),
   and agent_based INVENTORY_PLANNING and CONTROL_SYSTEM (aipcon). these
   subsystems are designed to cooperate together to facilitate just_in_time
   exchange of orders and materials.  under these subsystems, seven kinds of
   BASIC_AGENTS are defined, including customer, supplier, order, INVENTORY,
   product, supplier_order, and automatic_guided vehicle (AGV) AGENTS. we will
   describe our approach in designing and implementing
   WAREHOUSE_SYSTEMS_SIMULATION with AGENTS. using a PROTOTYPE_SYSTEM which was
   developed based on the MODEL, the paper presents some results of SIMULATION
   to show the validity of the MODEL.

AB AGENT'S meta_reasoning is a COMPUTATIONAL_PROCESS that implements AGENT'S
   capability to reason on a higher level about another AGENTS or a community
   of AGENTS. there is a potential for meta_reasoning in multi_agent systems.
   meta_reasoning can be used for reconstructing AGENTS' PRIVATE_KNOWLEDGE,
   their MENTAL_STATES and for PREDICTION of their FUTURE_COURSES of action.
   meta_agents should have the capability to reason about incomplete or
   IMPRECISE_INFORMATION. unlike the ORDINARY_AGENTS, the meta_agent may
   contemplate about the community of AGENTS as a whole and is expected to
   contribute to AGENT'S OPERATION_EFFICIENCY improvement.  this

AB DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEMS like SUPPLY_CHAINS can be efficiently managed by
   multi_agent approaches.  however, the CONTROL of each sub_system in a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN is a COMPLEX_OPTIMIZATION_PROBLEM where OPTIMAL_PERFORMANCE can
   be achieved using meta_heuristics.  this paper presents a NEW_METHODOLOGY
   for SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT, a distributed OPTIMIZATION using ANT_COLONIES,
   where the concepts of AGENTS and ANT_COLONY_OPTIMIZATION are merged, using
   the PHEROMONE_MATRIX as COMMUNICATION_PLATFORM. this PAPER_FORMALIZES this
   METHODOLOGY, using as an example a SUPPLY_CHAIN with logistic, supplying and
   DISTRIBUTION sub_systems.  2004 ieee.

AB despite the many advantages of ENTERPRISE_RESOURCES PLANNING (ERP) systems,
   they do not as yet represent a clear and SUCCESSFUL_MANAGEMENT_TOOL to small
   and medium sized ENTERPRISES (SMES), or at least it is not as easily
   implementable by SMES. this PAPER_SHARES some insight into a RESEARCH aimed
   at identifying the strategic and OPERATIONAL_REQUIREMENTS of SMES in the
   south east ASIA (sea) region.  it highlights a set of organizational,
   operational and SUPPLY_CHAIN related interdependencies in SMES which in many
   aspects influence PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_SUCCESS and methodologies deployed in
   ERP_SYSTEMS in SMES. an agent_based MODEL for coordinating the MANAGEMENT of
   ENTERPRISE_RESOURCE in SMES is also introduced.  this MODEL_EXPOUNDS on how
   the VARIOUS_ENTERPRISE_RESOURCES in an SME can be organized, interfaced and
   managed.  by drawing upon this MODEL, we can relate to how SMES can better
   project managed ERP_SYSTEMS in their usually INFORMAL_SYSTEMS.  2004

AB with increasing COMPETITION and better TRANSPORTATION_FACILITIES, the
   relationships between SUPPLY_CHAIN actors are getting more complex and
   INDIVIDUAL_PROFIT_MARGINS are shrinking.  decisions at DIFFERENT_LEVELS of
   the SUPPLY_CHAIN can no longer be considered independent, since they may
   influence PROFITABILITY across the SUPPLY_CHAIN. INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY
   based SOLUTION_FRAMEWORKS offer a way to more effectively integrate
   decision_making by enabling better KNOWLEDGE_SHARING and facilitating more
   transparent ECONOMIC_TRANSACTIONS. this paper proposes the use of a
   multi_agent SYSTEM to represent and integrate the decision_making processes
   of VARIOUS_ACTORS within the FOOD_GRAIN SUPPLY_CHAIN. within the context of

AB many researches and practices witness that there still are many problems,
   such as FRAGMENTATION, BUDGET_OVERRUN, TIME_OVERRUN and HIGH_WASTE in
   CONSTRUCTION_PROCESS, most of which are SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROBLEMS. these
   problems are often caused by the lack of COORDINATION between organizations
   in SUPPLY_CHAINS. this RESEARCH_REGARDS_CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY_CHAIN as a
   typical multi_agent SYSTEM and designs a multi_agent based multi_attribute
   NEGOTIATION_FRAMEWORK for CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION (mancscc).
   this FRAMEWORK_INTEGRATES the SPECIALTY_AGENTS (CONTRACTOR_AGENT,
   DESIGNER_AGENT, SUPPLIER_AGENT, OWNER_AGENT, etc.) and SERVICE_AGENTS
   (COORDINATOR_AGENT, MONITOR_AGENT, NAME_SERVER_AGENT) into a multi_agent
   SYSTEM through the INTERNET to improve decision_making EFFICIENCY. since
   DIFFERENT_MEMBERS in CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY_CHAIN have DIFFERENT_PREFERENCES on
   decision_making attributes, such as COST, time, quality, SAFETY and
   ENVIRONMENT, a multi_attribute NEGOTIATION_MECHANISM is established by
   describing the multi_attribute NEGOTIATION_PROCESS and designing the
   multi_attribute NEGOTIATION_PROTOCOL. the DESIGN of this mechanism is based
   on NEGOTIATION_THEORY and UTILITY_THEORY and aimed at promoting the
   COORDINATION between SPECIALTY_AGENTS. a PROTOTYPE_SYSTEM is developed and
   tested on a HYPOTHETICAL_CONSTRUCTION_PROJECT. the experiment indicates that
   mancscc provides a solution to CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION.

AB ENTERPRISE_RESOURCE_PLANNING_SYSTEMS tend to deploy SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT

   FUSE_INFORMATION to CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, MANUFACTURERS and WAREHOUSES, and
   therefore minimize system_wide COSTS while
   SATISFYING_SERVICE_LEVEL_REQUIREMENTS. although efficient, these systems are
   neither versatile nor adaptive, since newly discovered CUSTOMER_TRENDS
   cannot be easily integrated with existing KNOWLEDGE. advancing on the way
   the above mentioned techniques apply on ERP_SYSTEMS, we have developed a
   multi_agent SYSTEM that INTRODUCES_ADAPTIVE_INTELLIGENCE as a powerful
   add_on for ERP_SOFTWARE_CUSTOMIZATION. the SYSTEM can be thought of as a
   RECOMMENDATION_ENGINE, which takes advantage of KNOWLEDGE gained through the

   company selling POLICY. the INTELLIGENT_AGENTS of the SYSTEM can be

AB a local sanitary AGENCY _ lsa operating in an ITALIAN_REGION can be
   described as a multi_stage multi_service_center CHAIN, such that it can be

   SUCH_NETWORK consists of an ORGANIZATION of SERVICE_CENTERS which operate in
   the same health care_dedicated line and interact together to facilitate the
   patients' flows along the CHAIN of SANITARY_SERVICES. in order to assure
   effectiveness and EFFICIENCY to the HEALTH_CARE_NETWORK, two MAIN_PROBLEMS
   have to be approached: 1st.  how should the DIFFERENT_PHASES of HEALTH_CARE
   be organized in the SERVICE_CENTERS of the network such as to assure to each

   2nd.  how could a COLLABORATIVE_SERVICE_PLANNING_STRATEGY be defined such as
   to assure to the HEALTH_CARE_NETWORK, as a WHOLE_SYSTEM, CLEAR_PERSPECTIVES
   of SUSTAINABLE_OPERATIONS and DEVELOPMENT? this contribution will discuss an
   ADMISSIBLE_SOLUTION of the LSA_SERVICE_PLANNING_PROBLEM, assuming that
   SUCH_SYSTEM be modeled by a network of SERVICE_CENTER under

AB with the ever increasingly competitive and changing markets, the
   dependencies and relationships between MARKET_COMPONENTS are becoming more
   and more important.  more ENTERPRISES now consider the entire
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_STRUCTURE while taking BUSINESS_DECISIONS. they try to identify
   and manage all CRITICAL_RELATIONSHIPS both upstream and downstream in their
   SUPPLY_CHAINS. some impediments to this are that the NECESSARY_INFORMATION
   usually resides across a multitude of RESOURCES, is ever changing.  most
   SUPPLY_CHAIN DECISION_SUPPORT_SYSTEMS (dsss) are specific to an ENTERPRISE
   and ITS SUPPLY_CHAIN, and cannot be easily modified to assist other
   SIMILAR_ENTERPRISES and industries.  this contribution describes an on_going
   effort about developing an integrated framework to simulate
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT of MANUFACTURING_INDUSTRIES. RETAILERS, WAREHOUSES,
   PLANTS and RAW_MATERIAL_SUPPLIERS are modelled as a network of co_operative
   AGENTS. the ARCHITECTURE is composed of a multi_agent SYSTEM for the
   DECISIONAL_ORGANIZATION, a discrete_even SIMULATION_TOOL (arena) for the
   WORKSHOP_SIMULATION, an ADVANCED_PLANNING SYSTEM (finmatica/ortems) for the
   PRODUCTION_SCHEDULING, and a data_base for the storage of the
   TECHNICAL_DATA. this framework helps to analyze the BUSINESS_POLICIES with
   respect to DIFFERENT_SITUATIONS arising in the SUPPLY_CHAIN. we illustrate
   this framework by means of a CASE_STUDY.

AB participating members in a MANUFACTURING SUPPLY_CHAIN usually make use of an
   INFORMATION_SYSTEM like ENTERPRISE_RESOURCES PLANNING (ERP) for PLANNING and
   SCHEDULING_ACTIVITIES independently.  RECENT_RESEARCH indicates that there
   is a need to handle such distributed activities in an integrated manner,
   especially under uncertain and fast changing environments.  a
   MULTIAGENT_SYSTEM, a branch of distributed ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE, is a
   contemporary MODELLING TECHNIQUE for a DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM in the
   MANUFACTURING domain.  this distributed MODELLING TECHNIQUE is suitable for
   integrating SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS, which have distributed entities within
   the SYSTEM, and each of them makes DECISION locally, I.e.  a
   LOCAL_INFORMATION_SYSTEM. by adopting a MULTIAGENT_MODELLING TECHNIQUE,
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS can be built efficiently based on an
   INFORMATION_SYSTEM. however, with reference to the reported RESEARCH, which
   involves distributed MODELLING of a SUPPLY_CHAIN, a higher
   LEVEL_COORDINATION_MECHANISM is not specified.  this PAPER_AIMS to propose a

AB a USEFUL_INSIGHT into MANAGERIAL_DECISION_MAKING can be found from
   SIMULATION of BUSINESS_SYSTEMS, but existing work on SIMULATION of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN behaviour has largely considered non_competitive CHAINS. where
   COMPETITIVE_AGENTS have been examined, they have generally had a
   SIMPLE_STRUCTURE and been used for FUNDAMENTAL_EXAMINATION of STABILITY and
   equilibria rather than providing PRACTICAL_GUIDANCE to MANAGERS. in this
   paper, a NEW_AGENT for the study of competitive SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK
   DYNAMICS is proposed.  the NOVEL_FEATURES of the AGENT include the ability
   to select between competing vendors, distribute orders preferentially among
   many CUSTOMERS, MANAGE_PRODUCTION and INVENTORY, and determine price based
   on COMPETITIVE_BEHAVIOUR. the structure of the AGENT is related to existing
   BUSINESS_MODELS and SUFFICIENT_DETAILS are provided to allow implementation.
   the AGENT is tested to demonstrate that it recreates the MAIN_RESULTS of the
   existing MODELLING and MANAGEMENT_LITERATURE on SUPPLY_CHAIN DYNAMICS. a
   BRIEF_EXPLORATION of COMPETITIVE_DYNAMICS is given to confirm that the
   proposed AGENT can respond to COMPETITION. the results demonstrate that
   OVERALL_PROFITABILITY for a SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK is maximised when
   businesses operate collectively.  it is possible for an INDIVIDUAL_BUSINESS
   to achieve higher profits by adopting a more COMPETITIVE_STANCE, but the
   consequence of this is that the OVERALL_PROFITABILITY of the network is
   reduced.  the AGENT will be of use for a BROAD_RANGE of studies on the
   long_run effect of MANAGEMENT_DECISIONS on their network of SUPPLIERS and
   CUSTOMERS.

AB there are two MAIN_CONTRIBUTIONS of the work reported in the paper.  first,
   a NEW_MODEL of SOFTWARE_AGENTS is proposed that are polymorphic and highly
   mobile.  the former feature of AGENTS_RESULTS from the existence of
   potentially many AGENT_VERSIONS. the latter feature is implied by the fact
   that only the NECESSARY_AGENT_CODE is transmitted through the network, while
   the rest is transmitted only on DEMAND.. second, in the paper a
   PARTICULAR_APPROACH to develop and manage multi_agent environments is
   proposed.  it is based on so called AGENT_CLUSTERS which GROUP_AGENTS that
   mutually cooperate to perform a PARTICULAR_MISSION, e.g.  to build and
   manage SUPPLY_CHAINS, to negotiate details of orders, to sign
   BUSINESS_CONTRACT. the approach seems to be straightforward, on one hand,
   and allows practically unrestricted COLLABORATION among AGENTS of the same
   BUSINESS_PARTY, and SAFE_COOPERATION among DIFFERENT_BUSINESS_PARTIES, on
   the other hand.  the concept of AGENT_CLUSTER is inspired to some extent by
   the DATABASE_TECHNOLOGY, in particular by DATABASE_TRANSACTION_MANAGEMENT.

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION has become a CRITICAL_SUCCESS_FACTOR for
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM) and effectively improving the PERFORMANCE of
   organizations in VARIOUS_INDUSTRIES. COORDINATION_REFERS to the INTEGRATION
   of DIFFERENT_PARTS of an ORGANIZATION or DIFFERENT_ORGANIZATIONS in
   SUPPLY_CHAIN to accomplish a COLLECTIVE_SET of tasks and to achieve
   MUTUAL_BENEFITS. this PAPER_DEFINES the concepts of CONSTRUCTION
   SUPPLY_CHAIN (csc) and CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT, especially
   REGARDS_CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT as the COORDINATION of
   INTERORGANIZATIONS_DECISION_MAKING in CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY_CHAIN and the
   INTEGRATION of KEY_CONSTRUCTION_BUSINESS_PROCESSES and KEY_MEMBERS involved
   in CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY_CHAIN. much RESEARCH and practice indicate that there
   still are many problems in CONSTRUCTION, most of which are
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROBLEMS. the RESEARCH_ANALYZES the problems in CONSTRUCTION
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. in order to resolve these problems and improving the
   PERFORMANCE of CONSTRUCTION, an agent_based framework for CONSTRUCTION
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION is designed based on the AGENT_TECHNOLOGY and
   MULTIATTRIBUTE_NEGOTIATION and MULTIATTRIBUTE_UTILITY_THEORY (maut). the
   framework, which integrates the CONSTRUCTION_ORGANIZATIONS in CONSTRUCTION
   SUPPLY_CHAIN and MULTIATTRIBUTE_NEGOTIATION_MODEL into a MULTIAGENT_SYSTEM
   (MAS), provides a solution for SUPPLY_CHAIN_COORDINATION in CONSTRUCTION
   through MULTIATTRIBUTE_NEGOTIATION_MECHANISM on the INTERNET. finally, the
   prototype of the framework is developed and tentatively run based on an

AB the BULLWHIP_EFFECT is the AMPLIFICATION of the ORDER_VARIABILITY in a
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. this PHENOMENON_CAUSES IMPORTANT_FINANCIAL_COST due to higher
   INVENTORY_LEVELS and AGILITY_REDUCTION. in this paper, we study, for each
   company in a SUPPLY_CHAIN, the INDIVIDUAL_INCENTIVE to collaborate to reduce
   this problem.  to achieve this, we simulate a SUPPLY_CHAIN inspired by the
   QUEBEC_FOREST_INDUSTRY, in which each company is an AGENT that uses one of
   three ordering schemes.  each ordering scheme represents a level of
   COLLABORATION. one run of the SIMULATION is done with fifty (50) weeks for
   each of the 36 = 729 combinations of these 3 ordering schemes among the 6
   COMPANIES of the SIMULATION. in each run, we evaluate each company'S
   INVENTORY holding and BACKORDER_COSTS. these outcomes are used to build a
   GAME in the NORMAL_FORM, which is next analyzed using GAME_THEORY. in
   particular, we find two NASH_EQUILIBRIA incurring the MINIMUM_COST of the
   SUPPLY_CHAIN. we also note that there are no NASH_EQUILIBRIA in which some
   COMPANIES do not collaborate: collaborating COMPANIES have no INCENTIVE to

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT means the COORDINATION of all material and
   INFORMATION_FLOWS throughout the ENTIRE_VALUE_CHAIN. the MAIN_GOAL is to
   organise the OVERALL_PROCESS of the SUPPLY_CHAIN to achieve an optimum in
   COSTS and time, for example, by improving the following four figures, such
   as increasing CAPACITY_UTILIZATION, decreasing inventories, decreasing
   LEAD_TIME and increasing DELIVERY_RELIABILITY and adherence to
   DELIVERY_DATES. the CONVENTIONAL_CONTROL of SUPPLY_CHAINS pursuit top_down
   PLANNING approaches to coordinate the SUPPLY flows (incl.  material and
   infom1ation), run by CURRENT_ERP_SYSTEMS, between the DIFFERENT_ENTERPRISES
   participating in a SUPPLY_NETWORK. COLLABORATIVE SUPPLY NET_MANAGEMENT has
   technological and non_technological aspects.  from the non_technological
   point, aside from willingness to ORGANISATIONAL_CHANGES, a feeling of
   TRUSTFUL_PARTNERSHIP must evolve.  on the TECHNOLOGICAL_SIDE,
   AGENT_TECHNOLOGY is proposed as being indispensable to achieve INTEGRATION
   of ADVANCED_PLANNING systems (aps) across company borders.  thus, this paper
   proposes an agent_based approach to COLLABORATIVE SUPPLY NET_MANAGEMENT,
   based on the scor_model (SUPPLY_CHAIN_OPERATIONS reference_model). finally
   an example is given that sketches the idea of an agent_based
   SIMULATION_APPROACH to tackle the BULLWHIP_EFFECT.  2003 by springer

   and from the internal/heterogeneous PLANNING and
   SHOP_FLOOR_SUPERVISION_SYSTEMS. the utilisation of STANDARDS for inter_tools
   COMMUNICATION, INFORMATION_EXCHANGE and information MODELLING ascends in
   significance within this context.  they are seen as a base for an agile and
   LEAN_REACTION of the ENTERPRISE both in ITS NORMAL_OPERATION and in the

AB automated IDENTIFICATION_SYSTEMS which involve the automated retrieval of

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT is a concept that assumes a business as a CHAIN of
   inter_connected entities of commercial activities [24]. therefore, the
   OBJECTIVE of SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT is reducing INVENTORY, LEAD_TIMES and
   COST at each link under the given constraints.  in this paper, we propose a
   COOPERATION_MODEL for SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT using multi_agent SYSTEM. this
   MODEL_CONSTRUCTS a relevant SUPPLY_CHAIN through ITERATED_MATCHMAKING
   PROCESS. the matchmaking PROCESS makes connection between SERVICE_PROVIDER
   and SERVICE_REQUESTOR for each link of the SUPPLY_CHAIN [23]. the effective
   SUPPLY_CHAIN can be made when each link of the SUPPLY_CHAIN is connected
   properly.  in order to make a PROPER_CONNECTION for each link, this proposed
   MODEL_USES multi_agent SYSTEM as FOUNDATION_ARCHITECTURE and uses
   CLUSTERING, rule_based SYSTEM and NEURAL_NETWORKS as matching method.  with
   this MODEL, we can make OPTIMUM_CHAIN_CONNECTION from the PROCUREMENT to the
   customer.  2004 springer_verlag berlin heidelberg.

AB a multi_agent SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE for COORDINATION of just_in_time
   PRODUCTION and DISTRIBUTION is presented.  the problem to solve is twofold:
   first the RIGHT_AMOUNT of RESOURCES at the RIGHT_TIME should be produced,
   then these RESOURCES should be distributed to the RIGHT_CONSUMERS. in order
   to solve the first problem, which is hard when the PRODUCTION and/or
   DISTRIBUTION time is relatively long, each consumer is equipped with an
   AGENT that makes predictions of FUTURE_NEEDS that it sends to a
   PRODUCTION_AGENT. the second part of the problem is approached by FORMING
   clusters of consumers within which it is possible to REDISTRIBUTE_RESOURCES
   fast and at a LOW_COST in order to cope with discrepancies between predicted
   and ACTUAL_CONSUMPTION. REDISTRIBUTION_AGENTS are introduced (one for each
   CLUSTER) to manage the redistribution of RESOURCES. the suggested
   ARCHITECTURE is evaluated in a CASE_STUDY concerning MANAGEMENT of district
   heating systems.  results from a SIMULATION_STUDY_SHOW that the suggested
   approach makes it possible to CONTROL the trade_off between
   QUALITY_OF_SERVICE and degree of SURPLUS_PRODUCTION. we also compare the
   suggested approach to a REFERENCE_CONTROL_SCHEME (approximately
   corresponding to the CURRENT_APPROACH to district heating MANAGEMENT), and
   conclude that it is possible to reduce the amount of RESOURCES produced
   while maintaining the QUALITY_OF_SERVICE. finally, we describe a

AB MODERN_CHEMICAL_PRODUCTION is customer_driven and the desired DELIVERY_TIME
   for the products is often shorter than their CAMPAIGN_LENGTH. in addition,
   the RAW_MATERIALS supplying time is often long.  these features make it
   desirable to provide TOOLS to SUPPORT_COLLABORATIVE SUPPLY_CHAIN
   DECISION_MAKING, preferably over the INTERNET, and where there are
   CONFLICTS, COMPROMISE_DECISIONS can be quickly reached and the effects of
   the decisions can be quantitatively simulated.  this paper describes such a
   multi_agent SYSTEM (MAS) that can be used to simulate the DYNAMIC_BEHAVIOUR
   and support the MANAGEMENT of chemical SUPPLY_CHAINS over the INTERNET.
   geographically distributed RETAILERS, LOGISTICS, WAREHOUSES, PLANTS and
   RAW_MATERIAL_SUPPLIERS are modelled as an open and re_configurable network
   of co_operative AGENTS, each performing one or more SUPPLY_CHAIN FUNCTIONS.
   COMMUNICATION between AGENTS is made through the
   COMMON_AGENT_COMMUNICATION_LANGUAGE_KQML (KNOWLEDGE_QUERY_MESSAGE_LANGUAGE).
   at the SIMULATION_LAYER, the MAS allows DISTRIBUTED_SIMULATION of the
   CHAIN_BEHAVIOUR dynamically, so that COMPROMISE_DECISIONS can be rapidly and
   quantitatively evaluated.  because in a chemical SUPPLY_CHAIN the SCHEDULING
   of the plant often dominates the CHAIN_PERFORMANCE, an
   OPTIMUM_SCHEDULING_SYSTEM for BATCH_PLANTS is integrated into the MAS. the
   FUNCTIONS of the SYSTEM are illustrated by reference to a CASE_STUDY for the
   SUPPLY and MANUFACTURE using a multi_purpose batch plant of

AB agent_based technologies can be applied to many aspects of
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. the need for responsive, FLEXIBLE_AGENTS is
   pervasive in this ENVIRONMENT due to ITS complex, DYNAMIC_NATURE. two
   CRITICAL_ASPECTS of AGENT_CAPABILITIES are the ability to (1)
   CLASSIFY_AGENT_BEHAVIORS according' to AUTONOMY_LEVEL and (2) adapt
   problem_solving roles to various problem_solving situations during
   SYSTEM_OPERATION. SENSIBLE_AGENTS, capable of DYNAMIC_ADAPTIVE_AUTONOMY,
   have been developed to address these issues.  a SENSIBLE_AGENT'S
   "AUTONOMY_LEVEL" constitutes a description of the AGENT'S problem_solving
   role with respect to a PARTICULAR_GOAL. problem_solving roles are defined
   along a spectrum of AUTONOMY ranging from corrimand_driven, to CONSENSUS, to
   locally autonomous/master.  DYNAMIC_ADAPTIVE_AUTONOMY is a capability that
   allows SENSIBLE_AGENTS to change AUTONOMY_LEVELS during SYSTEM_OPERATION to
   meet the needs of a particular problem_solving situation.  this paper
   provides an overview of the SENSIBLE_AGENT testbed and introduces an example
   SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_DOMAIN with a scenario showing how this testbed
   could be used to simulate agent_based PROBLEM_SOLVING.  1999

AB SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT (SCM) is now recognised as one of the best means by
   which ENTERPRISES can make INSTANT_IMPROVEMENTS to their BUSINESS_STRATEGIES
   and OPERATIONS. SCM, however, is generally based on the SIMPLE_THEORY of
   constraints (toc) concept, and is not always concerned with
   PARETO_OPTIMAL_SOLUTIONS in PRODUCT_DISTRIBUTION. since
   MARKET_PRICE_SYSTEMS_CONSTITUTE a well_understood class of MECHANISMS that
   under CERTAIN_CONDITIONS provide EFFECTIVE_DECENTRALISATION of
   DECISION_MAKING with MINIMAL_COMMUNICATION_OVERHEAD, we propose SCM based on
   market_oriented programming in this paper.  in market_oriented programming,
   we take a metaphor of ECONOMY computing multi_agent behaviour literally, and
   directly implement the distributed computation as a MARKET_PRICE_SYSTEM. we
   define the AGENT_ACTIVITIES to negotiate the tradeoffs of acquiring
   DIFFERENT_RESOURCES, so as to realise the multi_echelon OPTIMISATION.
   several SIMULATION_EXPERIMENTS on the SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL with multi_echelon
   structure clarify th e MARKET_DYNAMICS that emerge through the
   AGENT_NEGOTIATIONS. it is confirmed that CAREFUL_CONSTRUCTIONS of the
   DECISION_PROCESS according to ECONOMIC_PRINCIPLES can LEAD to
   PARETO_OPTIMAL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATIONS in SCM, and the behaviour of the SYSTEM
   can be analysed in ECONOMIC_TERMS.  2001 elsevier science b.v.  all rights

AB this ARTICLE proposes a multi_agent INFORMATION_SYSTEM (mais) approach to
   MODEL the ORDER_FULFILLMENT_PROCESS (OFP) in SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORKS (scns).
   an ORDER_FULFILLMENT_PROCESS starts with receiving orders from CUSTOMERS and
   ends with delivery of the FINISHED_GOODS. as MANUFACTURING practice is
   shifting toward the out_sourcing paradigm, the OFP is more likely to be
   executed throughout scns.  it becomes imperative to integrate the OFP into
   scns to improve the OFP. the proposed multi_agent INFORMATION_SYSTEM (mais)
   approach is used for MODELING the OFP in scns, and evaluating
   OFP_PERFORMANCE by applying the proposed strategies.  the OBJECTIVE of
   REENGINEERING the OFP is to achieve AGILITY of the PROCESS in terms of
   EFFICIENCY, FLEXIBILITY, ROBUSTNESS and ADAPTABILITY. a multi_agent
   SIMULATION_PLATFORM, called SWARM, is enhanced and applied for MODELING the
   mais, and EXPERIMENTS are conducted to simulate the OFP in scns in a
   multi_agent ENVIRONMENT. based on the SWARM_SIMULATION_PLATFORM, we MODEL
   the OFP in scns, simulate the OFP, and then evaluate the
   POTENTIAL_OFP_IMPROVEMENT_STRATEGIES to identify USEFUL_STRATEGIES for
   improving the OFP. the results shed lights on identifying the main effects
   of VARIOUS_STRATEGIES on OFP_PERFORMANCE. the insights of utilizing
   VARIOUS_STRATEGIES in DIFFERENT_SCNS help redesign the OFP in scns.

AB the SUPPLY_CHAIN of a MANUFACTURING_ENTERPRISE is a WORLDWIDE_NETWORK of
   SUPPLIERS, factories, WAREHOUSES, DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS, and RETAILERS
   through which RAW_MATERIALS are acquired, transformed, and delivered to
   CUSTOMERS. SUPPLY_CHAIN FUNCTIONS must operate in a coordinated manner to
   OPTIMIZE_PERFORMANCE. but the DYNAMICS of the ENTERPRISE and the MARKET make
   this difficult: materials do not arrive on time, PRODUCTION_FACILITIES fail,
   and employees are ill, causing deviations from the plans.  in some cases,
   these events may be dealt with locally.  in other cases, the problem cannot
   be locally contained, and modifications across many FUNCTIONS are required.

   within IMPORTANT_ASPECTS of SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT. a SUPPLY_CHAIN_MODEL

   COMPONENTS which are holonicly made up of a RECURSIVE_HIERARCHY of three
   DIFFERENT_AGENT_TYPES: a co_ordination server and a set of co_ordination
   assistant AGENTS. the COORDINATION_SERVER represents a platform through
   which buyers and sellers can interact, provides MATCHMAKING_SERVICES, and is
   equipped with co_ordination MECHANISMS such as AUCTIONS, negotiations and
   COALITION_FORMATION_MECHANISMS. the co_ordination assistant AGENTS support
   their users, I.e.  buyers and sellers, in their MARKET_INTERACTIONS on the
   server.  particularly, they support their users in PURCHASING and selling of
   PRODUCT_BUNDLES because adopting optimal bidding and PRICING_STRATEGIES
   while taking part in many AUCTIONS simultaneously is a task too complex for
   humans to solve optimally.  the HOLONIC_STRUCTURE of the

AB as businesses adopt ELECTRONIC_COMMERCE, INFORMATION_EXCHANGE between
   BUSINESS_PARTNERS within a SUPPLY_CHAIN becomes more essential.
   INFORMATION_EXCHANGE is often considered when COMPANIES implement the
   EXTRANET. this STUDY_AIMS to analyze the impact of VARIOUS_LEVELS of
   INFORMATION_SHARING including order, INVENTORY, and DEMAND_INFORMATION,
   which is based on TRANSACTION_COSTS. this study further examines the effects
   on SUPPLY_CHAIN_PERFORMANCE in ELECTRONIC_COMMERCE. specifically, the
   MULTIAGENT_SIMULATION_SYSTEM_SWARM is employed to simulate and analyze the
   buyer_seller correlation in SHARING information among BUSINESS_PARTNERS in
   SUPPLY_CHAINS. our findings indicate that the more detailed information
   shared between firms, the lower the TOTAL_COST, the higher the
   ORDER_FULFILLMENT_RATE, and the shorter the ORDER_CYCLE_TIME. in other
   words, INFORMATION_SHARING may reduce the DEMAND_UNCERTAINTY that firms
   normally encounter.  firms that SHARE_INFORMATION between TRADING_PARTNERS
   tend to transact with a reduced number of SUPPLIERS. in sum, this
   WORK_ILLUSTRATES the effects of VARIOUS_LEVELS of INFORMATION_SHARING on

   PRODUCTION_ENGINEERING. we argue that the notion of AGENT_NEEDS to be
   clarified and that MAS_ARCHITECTURES must consequently be subject to
   FORMAL_DESCRIPTIONS. CONCURRENT_SPECIFICATION_LANGUAGES, such as
   PROCESS_CALCULI, can be regarded as SUITABLE_MODELS for this purpose.  the
   _calculus is therefore introduced through ITS syntax and an
   INFORMAL_DESCRIPTION of ITS semantic.  we then support the idea that this
   CALCULUS_FULFILS the requirements for MAS_ARCHITECTURE_DESCRIPTION,
   especially the aspects related to the INTERACTIONS between AGENTS. then, we
   focus on the SUPPLY_CHAIN_MANAGEMENT_PROBLEM: two AGENTS and their

   where AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS represent ENTERPRISES and manage the capacity of
   individual macro_resources in a production_distribution context.  the AGENTS
   are linked by client_supplier relationships and inter_agent COMMUNICATION

   COOPERATIVE_SCHEDULING_APPROACH, emphasizing a
   TEMPORAL_SCHEDULING_PERSPECTIVE of SCHEDULING_PROBLEMS, are described.  the
   SCHEDULING_APPROACH is based on a COORDINATION_MECHANISM supported by the
   interchange of CERTAIN_TEMPORAL_INFORMATION among pairs of client_supplier
   AGENTS involved.  this information allows the AGENTS to locally perceive
   HARD_GLOBAL_TEMPORAL_CONSTRAINTS and recognize non over_constrained problems
   and, in this case, rule out non temporally_feasible SOLUTIONS and establish
   an INITIAL_SOLUTION. the same kind of information is then used to guide
   re_scheduling to repair the INITIAL_SOLUTION and converge to a final one.

AB the MULTIAGENT_ENVIRONMENT for SUPPLY_CHAIN PLANNING application is based on
   a framework unifying the INTERNAL_BEHAVIOUR of AGENTS and COORDINATION among
   AGENTS. this SYSTEM presents a FORMAL_VIEW of COORDINATION using
   CONTRACT_NET_PROTOCOL (cnp) that relies on the BASIC_LOOP of
   AGENT_BEHAVIOURS: order receiving, order announcement, BID_CALCULATION, and
   ORDER_SCHEDULING followed by ORDER_EXECUTION. among these, BID_CALCULATION
   is most difficult.  it needs to determine the quantity, COST and time in
   which a NEW_ORDER can be implemented.  FUZZY programming has made progress
   in mathematics since bellman and zadeh (1970) first studied decision_making
   in a FUZZY_MATHEMATICS programming.  currently there are many VALUABLE_WORKS
   in this field (zimmermann 1983, 1985, tanaka and asai 1984) and FUZZY
   programming has become an EFFECTIVE_TOOL to deal with the decision_making
   problems in FUZZY_SYSTEMS. similarly, STOCHASTIC_PROGRAMMING is a
   USEFUL_TOOL to treat decision_making problems in a STOCHASTIC_SYSTEM (kolbin
   1977, kall and wallace 1994). however, in many PRACTICAL_SYSTEMS,
   FUZZY_FACTORS and RANDOM_FACTORS arise concurrently, and this problem has
   not received the attention it deserves.  therefore, there is a need to
   develop a NEW_KIND of OPTIMIZATION_TECHNIQUE to make decisions in a
   FUZZY_RANDOM_SYSTEM. in this paper, we build the BID_CALCULATION_MODEL,
   including a RANDOM_PARAMETER set, the set of PRODUCT_QUANTITY that will be
   stored to INVENTORY, a FUZZY_PARAMETER set, the MAXIMUM_SALES_RATES (msr)
   set, and we discuss an approach to solve the MODEL, as well as present an
   IMPLEMENTATION_PROCEDURE with the GA_METHOD.

AB an ORDER_FULFILLMENT_PROCESS (OFP) starts with receiving orders from
   CUSTOMERS and ends with delivering the FINISHED_GOODS. the
   ORDER_FULFILLMENT_PROCESS is complex because it is composed of several
   activities, executed by DIFFERENT_FUNCTIONAL_ENTITIES, and heavily
   interdependent among the tasks, RESOURCES, and AGENTS involved in the
   PROCESS. a SUPPLY_CHAIN_NETWORK (scn) is a network of autonomous or
   semi_autonomous BUSINESS_ENTITIES involved, through upstream and downstream
   links, in the DIFFERENT_PROCESSES and activities that produce goods or
   services to CUSTOMERS. as MANUFACTURING PRACTICE_SHIFTS toward the
   OUTSOURCING paradigm, the OFP is more likely to be executed throughout scns.
   it becomes imperative to integrate the OFP into scns to improve the OFP.
   generalizing from the variety and COMPLEXITY of scns, this STUDY_IDENTIFIES
   several MAIN_TYPES of SCN_STRUCTURES and ADDRESSES_OFP_ISSUES based on them.
   the OBJECTIVE of REENGINEERING the OFP is to achieve AGILITY in the PROCESS
   in terms of EFFICIENCY, FLEXIBILITY, ROBUSTNESS, and ADAPTABILITY. we
   propose a MULTIAGENT_INFORMATION_SYSTEM (mais) approach for REENGINEERING
   the off in scns.  the MAIS_MODELS the OFP in scns and evaluates off
   PERFORMANCE by applying the proposed strategies.  a
   MULTIAGENT_SIMULATION_PLATFORM, called SWARM, is enhanced and applied for
   MODELING the mais; and EXPERIMENTS are conducted to simulate the OFP and
   then evaluate the POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENT_STRATEGIES to identify
   USEFUL_STRATEGIES for improving the OFP. the strategies we evaluated include
   (1) coordinating DEMAND_MANAGEMENT_POLICIES, (2) INFORMATION_SHARING
   strategies, (3) synchronizing material and CAPACITY_AVAILABILITY, (4)
   DYNAMIC_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION, and (5) the combination of VARIOUS_STRATEGIES.
   the results shed light on identifying the main effects of VARIOUS_STRATEGIES
   on OFP_PERFORMANCE. the insights from utilizing VARIOUS_STRATEGIES in
   DIFFERENT_SCNS help reengineer the OFP in scns.

AB a GLOBAL_ECONOMY and increase in CUSTOMER_EXPECTATIONS in terms of COST and

   MODELS with SUFFICIENT_FIDELITY to the actual SUPPLY_CHAIN of interest.  in
   this paper, we describe a SUPPLY_CHAIN MODELING framework designed to
   overcome this difficulty.  using our approach, SUPPLY_CHAIN MODELS are
   composed from SOFTWARE_COMPONENTS that represent types of SUPPLY_CHAIN
   AGENTS (e.g., RETAILERS, MANUFACTURERS, transporters), their
   CONSTITUENT_CONTROL_ELEMENTS (e.g., INVENTORY_POLICY), and their
   INTERACTION_PROTOCOLS (e.g., MESSAGE_TYPES). the underlying library of
